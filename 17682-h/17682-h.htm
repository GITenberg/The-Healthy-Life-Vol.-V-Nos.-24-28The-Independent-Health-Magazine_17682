<p><span class="firstletter">S</span>ome laymen are very fond of deprecating the
work of specialists, holding that specialisation
tends to narrowness, to inability to see
more than one side of a question.</p>

<p>It is, of course, true that the specialist tends to
&ldquo;go off at a tangent&rdquo; on his particular subject,
and even to treat with contempt or opposition the
views of other specialists who differ from him.
But all work that is worth doing is attended by
its own peculiar dangers. It is here that the work
of the non-specialist comes in. It is for him to
compare the opposing views of the specialists, to
reveal one in the light thrown by the other, to help
into existence the new truth waiting to be born of
the meeting of opposites.</p>

<p>Specialisation spells division of labour, and apart
from division of labour certain great work can never
be done. To do away with such division, supposing
an impossibility to be possible, would simply mean
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg436" id="Pg436"></a> primitive savage. But
we have no call to attempt the abolition of even the
minutest division of labour. What is necessary is
to understand and guard against its dangers.</p>

<p>Specialisation <i>may</i> lead to madness, as electricity
<i>may</i> lead to death. But no specialist need go far
astray who, once in a while, will make an honest
attempt to come to an understanding with the man
whose views are diametrically opposed to his own.
For thus he will retain elasticity of brain, and gain
renewed energy for, and perhaps fresh light on,
his own problems.&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>




<h2><a name="CAMPING_OUT1" id="CAMPING_OUT1"></a>CAMPING OUT.</h2>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Five-Foot Sausage.</span></h3>


<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he question of blankets and mattresses may be
taken as settled. We can now sleep quite comfortably,
take our fresh air sleeping and waking,
and find shelter when it rains. But that same fresh
air brings appetite and we must see how that appetite
is to be appeased.</p>

<p>Take a frying-pan. It should be of aluminium for
lightness; though a good stout iron one will help you
make good girdle-cakes, if you get it hot and drop the
flour paste on it. You must find some other way of
making girdle-cakes, and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'of'.">if</ins> you take an iron frying
pan with you, don't say that I told you to.</p>

<p>Though it is obviously necessary that a frying-pan
should have a handle, I was bound to tell Gertrude that
I do not find it convenient to take handled saucepans
when I go camping. I take for all boiling purposes,
including the making of tea, what is called a camp-kettle.
Most ironmongers of any standing seem to keep
it, and those who have it not in stock can show you an
illustration of it in their wholesale list. It is just like
the pot in which painters carry their paint, except that
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg439" id="Pg439"></a>it has an ordinary saucepan lid. You should have a
&ldquo;nest&rdquo; of these&mdash;that is, three in diminishing sizes going
one inside the other. The big lid then fits on the outer
one and the two other lids have to be carried separately.</p>

<div class="center">
   <a id="sausage" name="sausage"></a>

      title="The Five-Foot Sausage" height="332" width="450" />
   <p class="caption"><i>The Five-Foot Sausage</i></p>
</div>

<p>You hang these camp-kettles over the fire by their
bucket handles, from the tripod or other means of
getting over the fire. Sometimes the bough of a tree
high out of the reach of the flames will do. Sometimes
a stick or oar thrust into the bank or in a crevice of
the wall behind the fire is more convenient than a
tripod. Again, you can do without any hanging at
all, making a little fireplace of bricks or stones and
standing the saucepans &ldquo;on the hob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a simple thing to tie the tops of three sticks
together and make a tripod. Then from the place where
they join you dangle a piece of string, pass it through
the handle of the kettle and tie it to itself, in a knot
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg440" id="Pg440"></a>that can be adjusted up or down to raise or lower the
kettle from the fire. This knot is our old friend the two
half-hitches. Pass the loose end round the down cord,
letting it come back under the up cord, then round
again with the same finish, and lo! the up cord makes
two half-hitches round the down cord. You can slip,
them up and put them where you like and they will
hold, but you have to undo them to take the kettle
clean away from the fire. So we add to our equipment
a few pot-hooks or pieces of steel wire shaped like
an S. Their use will be obvious. If we have three of
them it is quite easy to keep three kettles going over
one fire. They swing cheek by jowl when they all want
the same amount of fire, but each can be raised or
lowered an inch or several inches to let them respectively
boil, simmer or just keep warm.</p>

<p>These are the cooking utensils. A biscuit tin would
make an oven and Gertrude says she must have an oven.
For my part I would not attempt baking when camping
out and I will say no more about ovens, except that
all the biscuit tins in the world won't beat a hole in the
ground first filled with blazing sticks and then with the
things to be baked and covered with turves till they are
done.</p>

<p>I had great difficulty in persuading Gertrude to feed
out of tin dishes like those which we use sometimes
for making shallow round cakes or setting the toffee
in. They are ever so much better than plates, being
deep enough for soup-plates and not easy to upset when
you use them on your lap. Any number of the same
size will go into one another and a dozen scarcely take
up more room than one.</p>

<p>It was worse still when it came to a still more useful
substitute, the camp equivalent of the teacup. In the
first place we abolish the saucer, for the simple reason
that we have no earthly use for it in camp. We take
tin mugs with sloping sides and wire bucket handles.
They fit into one another in the same accommodating
way as the eating dishes. Gertrude was nearly put off
this device altogether by Basil's remark that he had
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg441" id="Pg441"></a>only seen them in use in poulterers' shops, where they
are put under hares' noses....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Basil, you, you monster,&rdquo; cried Gertrude, and I
had to push those tin mugs as though I had been a
traveller interested in the sale of them.</p>

<p>The drinking of hot tea out of these mugs is quite
a beautiful art. You hold the wire handle between
finger and thumb and put the little finger at the edge
of the bottom rim. It is thus able to tilt the mug to
the exact angle which is most convenient for drinking.
When Gertrude had learnt the trick, she became perfectly
enamoured of the mugs. She sometimes brings
one out at ordinary afternoon tea and insists that the
tea is ever so much better drunk thus than out of spode.</p>

<p>Smaller mugs of the same shape do for egg-cups,
and the egg-spoons I take to camp are the bone ones,
seldom asked for but easy to get in most oil-and-colour
shops. Dessert spoons and forks and table knives are
of the usual pattern, but the former can be had in
aluminium and therefore much lighter than Britannia
metal.</p>

<p>The camping-out valise is by all means the rucksack.
Never the knapsack. I am almost ashamed to say this,
because as far as my knowledge goes the knapsack is
now obsolete. It may be, however, that it lingers here
and there. If you see one, buy it for a museum if you
like but not for use. The bundle should be allowed to
fit itself to the back, as it does in a canvas bag. Suppose
now that you fix the V point of a pair of braces somewhere
near the top of the sack and bringing the webs
over your shoulders, fix them, nicely adjusted, to the
lower corners of the sack, it will ride quite comfortably
upon your back&mdash;that is, you have made it from a
plain sack into a rucksack or back-sack. Get or make
as many good large strong ones as you have shoulders
in the party to carry them. Have them made of a
waterproof canvas, green or brown, to reeve up tight
with strong cord passed through a series of eyelet-holes
and, if you would be quite certain of keeping out the
rain, with a little hood to cover the reeved bag end.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg442" id="Pg442"></a>The great bulk of your luggage you will generally
find it best to carry by wheeling it on a bicycle. Spread
your ground-sheet on the floor. On that lay your
blankets, doubled so as to make a smaller square, tent,
mattress cover and bed suits on that, then your camping
utensils and all other paraphernalia and roll the
whole up into a sausage about five feet long, when the
loose ends of the ground-sheet have been tucked over
as in a brown-paper parcel. Tie it well with whipcord
and fasten it to the top bar of your bicycle frame, leaving
freedom of course for the handles and the front wheel
to move and steer. Push the tent-poles through the
lashings and start for your camp at a comfortable four
or five miles an hour. You will find it easy to move
camp at the rate of twenty miles a day and will see a
great deal of country in the course of a fortnight.</p>

<p>The sausage on the bicycle shown in the illustration
may be taken to contain all the gear and a little food.
The rucksacks will take the rest and each man's
most precious personal belongings. There is a small
parcel tied to the handle-bar, scarcely to be seen because
it is smaller than the end of the sausage. It is a
complete tent tied up in its ground-sheet.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT1" id="HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT1"></a>HOW MUCH SHOULD WE EAT:
A WARNING.</h2>


<p><i>This article, by one of the pioneers of modern
dietetics, is in the nature of a challenge, and is certain
to arouse discussion among all who have studied the food
question closely.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen men lived on their natural food, quantities
settled themselves. When a healthy natural
appetite had been sated the correct quantity of
natural food had been taken.</p>

<p>To-day all this is upside down, there is no natural
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg443" id="Pg443"></a>food and only too often no natural healthy appetite
either. Thus the question of quantity is often asked
and many go wrong over it. The all-sufficient answer
to this question is: &ldquo;Go back to the foods natural to
the human animal and this, as well as a countless
number of other problems, will settle themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But supposing that this cannot be done, suppose, as
is often the case, that the animal fed for years on
unnatural food has become so pathological that it can
no longer take or digest its natural food?</p>

<p>Those who take foods which are stimulants are very
likely to overeat, and when they leave off their stimulants
they are equally likely to underfeed themselves.
Flesh foods are such stimulants, for it is possible to
intoxicate those quite unaccustomed to them with a
large ration of meat just as well as with a large ration
of alcohol. The one leads to the other, meat leads to
alcohol, alcohol to meat. Taking any stimulant eventually
leads to a call for other stimulants.</p>

<p>How are we to tell when a given person is getting
enough food, either natural or partly natural? Medically
speaking, there is no difficulty; there are plenty of
guides to the required knowledge, some of them of
great delicacy and extreme accuracy. The trouble
generally is that these guides are not made use of, as
the cause of the disaster is not suspected. A physiologist
is not consulted till too late, perhaps till the disorder
in the machinery of life is beyond repair.</p>

<p>Diminishing energy and power, decreasing endurance,
slowing circulation, lessening blood colour, falling
temperature, altered blood pressure, enlarging heart
and liver, are some of the most obvious signs with which
the physician is brought into contact in such cases.
But every one of these may, and very often does, pass
unnoticed for quite a long time by those who have had
no scientific training. The public are extremely ignorant
on such matters because the natural sciences have been
more neglected in this country in the last fifty years
than anywhere else in Europe, and that is saying a
good deal. Hence diet quacks and all those who trade
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg444" id="Pg444"></a>on the ignorance and prejudices of the public are having
a good time and often employ it in writing the most
appalling rubbish in reference to the important subject
of nutrition.</p>

<p>Being themselves ignorant and without having studied
physiology, even in its rudiments, they do not appear
to consider that they should at least abstain from teaching
others till they have got something certain for
themselves.</p>

<p>If the public were less ignorant they would soon see
through their pretensions; but, as it is, things go from
bad to worse, and it is not too much to say that
hundreds of lives have been lost down this sordid by-path
of human avarice.</p>

<p>On one single day a few weeks ago the writer heard
of three men, two of whom had been so seriously ill
that their lives were in danger, and one of whom had
died. The certified cause of death in this case might
not have led the uninitiated to suspect chronic starvation,
but those who were behind the scenes knew that
this was its real cause. A further extraordinary fact
was that two out of these three men were members of
the medical profession, whose training in physiology
ought, one would have thought, to have saved them
from such errors.</p>

<p>The conclusion seems to be that they did not use their
knowledge because at first they had no suspicion of the
real cause of their illness. In other words, chronic
starvation is insidious and, if no accurate scientific
measurements are made, its results, being attributed to
other causes, are often allowed to become serious
before they are properly treated.</p>

<p>These three men went wrong by following a layman
quite destitute of physiological training, who <span class="smcap">appeared</span>
to have produced some wonderful results in himself and
others on extraordinarily small quantities of food.</p>

<p>If the above tests had been made at once by a trained
hand the error involved in such results could not have
escaped detection, and none of these men would have
endangered their lives. I myself examined the layman
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg445" id="Pg445"></a>in question and finding him not up to standard refused
to follow him. The writer has no difficulty in recalling
at least a dozen cases similar to those above mentioned
which have been under his care in the last twelve
months, and the three above mentioned were none of
them under his care at the time of their danger.</p>

<p>What, then, must be our conclusions in reference to
these and similar facts of which it is only possible to
give a mere outline here? I suggest that they are:&mdash;</p>

<ol><li>Food quantities are of extreme importance.</li>

<li>These quantities were settled by physiologists
many years ago, and no good reasons have since been
adduced for altering them.</li>

<li>The required quantity is approximately nine or ten
grains of proteid per day for each pound of bone and
muscle in the body weight.</li>

<li>Any considerable departure from this quantity
continued over months and years leads to disaster.</li>

<li>The nature of this disaster may appear to be very
various and its real cause is thus frequently overlooked.</li></ol>

<p>I will say a few words about each of these except the
first, which is already obvious. The layman above
mentioned asserted that he could live on but little more
than half this quantity, but the food quantity really
required is that which will keep up normal strength,
normal circulation, normal colour, normal temperature
and normal mental power. As we have got perfectly
definite standards of all these normal conditions, serious
danger can only be run into by neglecting to measure
them.</p>

<p>It is also possible to tell fairly accurately the quantity
of food a man is taking in a day, and then, by collecting
and estimating his excreta, the quantity also out of
this food which he is utilising completely and burning
up in his body.</p>

<p>You would say that no danger should be possible with
all these safeguards, and yet the above case history
shows that of two trained physiologists, members of
the medical profession, one died at least twenty years
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg446" id="Pg446"></a>before his time, and the other was in great danger and
only recovered slowly and with difficulty. Another
similar case came to the writer suffering from increasing
debility and what appeared to be some form of dyspepsia.
He was quite unable to pass any of the above-named
tests as to physiological standards, and an investigation
of his excreta showed that his food was at least one-fifth
or one-sixth below its proper quantity and had
probably been so for many months past. Some of his
doctors had been giving his &ldquo;disease&rdquo; a more or less
long list of names and yet had not noted the one
essential fact of chronic defective nutrition and its
cause&mdash;underfeeding. Naturally their treatment was of
no avail, but when he had been sent to a nursing home
and had put back the 20 lbs. of weight he had lost he
came slowly back to more normal standards and is now
out of danger. In this case there was marked loss of
weight, and few people, one would think, would overlook
such a sign of under nutrition. But loss of weight
is not always present in these cases, at least not at first.
Some people tend to grow stout on deficient proteid,
and then the fact that some of the essential tissues of the
body (the muscles, the heart and the blood) are being
dangerously impoverished is very likely to be overlooked.
In the case last mentioned the loss of weight
was put down to the dyspepsia, whereas the real fact
was that the &ldquo;dyspepsia&rdquo; and loss of weight were both
results of a chronic deficiency in food.</p>

<p>It is evident that some care about food quantities
must be taken by all those who do not live on natural
foods. For physiologists there is no difficulty in settling
the question of quantity in accordance with the signs
of the physiology of a normal body. That all, even
physiologists, may run into danger if, while living on
unnatural or partly unnatural foods, or while making
any change of food, they do not consider the question
of quantity with sufficient care.</p>

<p>That the question of nutrition should be considered in
relation to <i>every illness</i> even though it may appear on
the surface to have no direct connection with foods or
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg447" id="Pg447"></a>quantities. As a matter of fact, the nature of the food
and its quantity controls all the phenomena of life.
Some twenty years ago most people lived fairly close to
the old physiological quantities, now they have been
cut adrift from these and completely unsettled and are
floundering out of their depth. A most unsatisfactory,
even dangerous, condition of affairs.</p>

<p>For the public it will now probably suffice if they
insist on raising the question of quantity whenever they
suffer in any way. If they are unable to answer the
question themselves let them go to a trained physiologist
who can do so, and not to a diet quack. But muscular
strength, endurance, mental and bodily energy, skin
circulation, temperature and blood colour are all things
which the public can see for themselves and from which
they should in all cases be able to get sufficient warning
to save them from the worst forms of disaster.</p>

<p>Some people imagine that they eat very little, when as
a matter of fact they have good healthy appetites.
Others again think they are eating a great deal, when
as a matter of fact they take very little. In both cases
a physiological test of the excreta will give accurate
information. I once had a medical patient who imagined
that he produced great amounts of force and performed
feats of endurance on wonderfully small quantities of
food. His excreta showed, however, that he was merely
under-estimating the food he took. A fat man may
seem to be living on very little, but fat does not require
to be fed, and his real bone and muscle weight is not
large. A thin man may seem to require a large quantity
of food, but he is really very heavy in bone and muscle,
the tissues that have to be nourished. In all these ways
appearances are apt to be deceptive for those who are
ignorant of science and who do not go down to the root
of the matter.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to follow the given quantity of
grains per pound slavishly and without regard to consequences.
It is necessary to see that the required physiological
results are obtained.</p>

<p>If a patient says he can live on less than I ordered for
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg448" id="Pg448"></a>him and if he can pass the physiological tests satisfactorily
I know that his bone and muscle weight has
been over-estimated. On the other hand, if a patient
falls below the physiological tests, though taking and
digesting the quantities ordered for him, I conclude that
his bone and muscle weight has been under-estimated.</p>

<p>In all cases it is possible to obtain the best physiological
results and to say when quantities are just right,
neither too much nor too little.</p>

<p>The evil effects of too much are not serious; they
entail perhaps a little &ldquo;gout&rdquo; or some temporary loss
of freedom from waste products.</p>

<p>The evil effects of too little, if persevered in and
continued, especially if some of these effects are attributed
to causes which have no real existence, are deadly
and dangerous, for they bring on an insidious deterioration
both of function and structure which leads by
several avenues, often miscalled &ldquo;diseases,&rdquo; to death
itself.</p>

Palmyra palm, which in India and Ceylon supports six
or seven millions of people, and &ldquo;works&rdquo; also in West
Africa, where it is probably native. It gives its young
shoots and unripe seeds as food; its trunk makes a whole
boat, or a drum or a walking-stick, according to size;
hats, mats, thread and baskets&mdash;in fact, almost all
kinds of clothing and utensils&mdash;are made from the split
and plaited leaves; gum comes from it, and certain
medicines, jaggery sugar too and an intoxicating drink
for those who desire it. In one of the museums at Kew&mdash;a
wet day brings always <i>something</i> besides disappointment&mdash;there
is a book made up of the very
leaves of the palm, containing a Tamil poem enumerating
more than eight hundred human uses to which this
marvellous single plant can be put.</p>

<p>Now the imagination is like a Palmyra palm. We
stand a long way off and, looking up, say &ldquo;What a
graceful tree! But what a pity it produces that intoxicating
&lsquo;toddy&rsquo; and nothing else!&rdquo; Yet all the while
food and clothing and shelter and travel and learning
are all wrapped up in it, if only we were not too
ignorant to guess, or too idle to seek.</p>

<p>We talk as if the poet and painter had need of
imagination, but not the student, the doctor, the philanthropist,
the business man, whereas none of these
can do work at a really human standard without
imagination that is living, penetrating, active and yet
trained and disciplined.</p>

<p>A recent illuminating address to a body of students
pointed out that Germany's immense industrial strides
have been made possible by an education which draws
men's minds out of narrow old grooves, and helps them
to see and grasp wider possibilities. But the same
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg450" id="Pg450"></a>speaker went on to point out that the English worker
has far more real initiative and imagination than the
German, and that in our own country we have not even
to make elaborate plans for developing these qualities,
but rather to release them in our administrators so far
as to prevent actually checking them in the children now
growing up.</p>

<p>Imagination in business, for instance, means new
possibilities, fresh sources of supply and fresh markets
to demand, economy of working and better adjustment
of work to worker, so as to have less waste of our
greatest capital, human time and power. America has
taught us something in these respects; what we must
do is to take what new light she has developed, while
keeping our long-grown, well-earned skill which she
has not had the chance to make.</p>

<p>In research work, again, we need perpetually the
synthetic and constructive imagination if individual
work is not to become narrowly specialised and shut
off from other divergent or parallel lines which would
illuminate it. The other day I was told of a great
surgeon who not only has six or seven assistants to
help him in his immediate tasks, but also, since he is
too busy in the service of humanity to have time for
reading, has eight trained assistants whose business it
is to read in many languages what is being done all
over the civilised world in his own line, and keep him
informed as to the development of experience. A
wonderful advance on the crystallisation of individual
method, this, and yet it needed but the imaginative
projection upon scientific work of what every business
firm and every political unit has long done.</p>

<p>To transfer to our own concerns a method developed
elsewhere is one of the most valuable services imagination
can render. Almost all educational reform comes
about thus, most mechanical inventions, a great part of
economy and comfort in individual homes. Also,
besides these particular advantages, the incessant
coming and going between the different fields of activity,
the circulation of attention which this use of the imagi<a class="pagenum" name="Pg451" id="Pg451"></a>nation
involves, tends to vitalise and enrich not only
the individuals who carry it out, but the whole social
organism of which they form part.</p>

<p>Upon the moral side not much need be said. &ldquo;Put
yourself in his place&rdquo; is a very old and respectable
recipe for growing justice in one's conduct, consideration
in one's speech, sympathy in one's heart. As
employer or magistrate, as teacher or nurse, as customer
or shopman, as parent or husband or child we must all
deal somehow with our fellow-men: honestly and truthfully,
we mean, kindly and helpfully, we hope. But is
it not the more or the less of our imagination that
makes such dealings possible? Without it, we are cruel
because of something we do not feel, unjust because
there is something we do not know, unwittingly deceitful
because there is something we do not understand.
With it, our justice will support, our kindness uplift,
our attempt at help will not be barren, but will awake
response and raise the whole level of our human intercourse
into a region of higher possibilities.</p>

<h3><a name="Flowers" id="Flowers"></a><span class="smcap">To-Morrow's Flowers.</span></h3>


<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>hese three months of July, August and September
are the second seed-time. I think they must
be the most proper sowing-time, for is it not
clear that Nature sows seed, not in spring, but in
autumn? At any rate, now we can do more towards
making a perpetually beautiful flower garden than in
any other season. The biennials, those that blossom in
their second year of life and those jolly perennials that
come up year after year and always stronger than
before, without any trouble on our part, are best started
in life not too long before the winter. Spring-sown
seed sometimes forgets that it is biennial and blossoms
rather futilely the same summer, and at other times it
grows so lush and large by winter that it cannot stand
the frost.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg452" id="Pg452"></a>Now we see the flowers in blossom in the vineyards
of our friend Naboth and we know which we should
most like in our own garden. There is an exquisite
joy in begging or stealing a few seeds and bringing
them home to blossom for us as they did for Naboth.
I carry at this time a few small envelopes bought for
a few pence a hundred at Straker's, and whenever I
see something nice in seed I bag it. In another week
it would drop beneath the plant it grew on and, not
being cared for by a gardener, would be smothered or
hoed up. In a nice little seed-bed all to itself it can
unfold all manner of pleasure for its abductor.</p>

<p>Plant your flower seeds on a nice ripe, rich bed&mdash;that
is, one compounded of old and even half-used
manure. Keep the seedlings watered as they grow and
by judicious pricking-out give them the room they need.
About October you can plant the best of them in the
place where you want a good bush next year, and, if it
is a perennial, you have for many years to come a
beautiful plant with a personal history. Even if you
have bought your penn'orth of seed there may be a
pleasant anecdote connected with it. My garden is at
present amazingly blue with Dropmore Alkanet
(Anchusa). Three years ago I bought three seeds for
a penny. Two of them came up. I slashed up the
plants and now I have half-a-dozen clumps as well as
a similar number left in the old garden whence I have
removed.</p>

<p>If you asked me what kinds of seed in particular you
ought to plant for perennial flowers just now, I might
want many more pages to tell you in. Let me give you
a very short list of those that most appeal to me on the
spur of the moment. It will be enough to go on with:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="off">
<li>Trollius (globe flower).</li>
<li>Helianthemum (rock rose).</li>
<li>Epilobium (willow herb).</li>

<li style="margin-top:0.75em;">Hollyhock.</li>
<li>Echinops (globe thistle).</li>
<li>Anchusa Italica, Dropmore variety.</li>

<li style="margin-top:0.75em;">Lupine.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg453" id="Pg453"></a></li>
<li>Tritoma (red-hot poker).</li>
<li>Heuchera (coral-root).</li>
<li>Yarrow.</li>

<li style="margin-top:0.75em;">Lychnis (garden campion).</li>
<li>Inula (Elecampane).</li>
<li>Funkia (Plaintain lily).</li>
<li>Eremurus.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is representative because it includes some
species, such as Eremurus, Trollius and Tritoma, that
are not usually grown from seed by the amateur. To
raise these rather expensive monsters from pennyworths
of seed is a floral adventure which brings its own
abundant reward.</p>

<p>I should be very proud of a garden that consisted
entirely of plants that I had raised from seed. It might
be one that had never had anything else in or the
seedlings might gradually oust the bulbs and corms
and grown plants with which the garden began. There
would be many things there intrinsically as well as
extrinsically valuable. Carnation seed, for example, is
constantly producing new varieties, and to grow rose
seedlings is even to court fortune. It is a long time
before you see your rose. The seed takes sometimes
two years to germinate, and then you have to wait a
year or two before you get a typical blossom. The
growers hurry matters by cutting a very tiny bud from
the first sprout and splicing that on to an older stock.
One of the advantages of having your roses grown
from seed and on their own stocks would be that they
could not produce wild suckers.</p>

<p>I have just seen a wonderful grove of Aquilegias, the
glorified columbine which has the centre of one colour
and the outside petals of another&mdash;sulphur with mauve
or yellow with pink, and many other varieties. The
nucleus was grown from shop seed and the rest from the
seed of the first-comers. The only thing to choose
between them is that the new ones have produced a
least one variety not represented in the first batch.
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg454" id="Pg454"></a>You may be sure that I am going to get some seed from
here and raise some Aquilegias for myself. Good
reader, go thou and do likewise.</p>

<h2><a name="MIDSUMMER_MADNESS" id="MIDSUMMER_MADNESS"></a>MIDSUMMER MADNESS.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">W</span>e had come, &ldquo;3.7&rdquo; and I, to the Boundary,
a white, unpaved road which winds across
the full width of Wimbledon Common, from
the old Roman camp to the windmill. Simultaneously
we cried a halt, I because I never cross that road
without some hesitation, he because he wanted to get
out of the folding go-cart in which he had been riding
and turn it, with the aid of a small piece of string and
a big piece of imagination, into a 40-horse-power motor
car.</p>

<p>On the map the road is not called the Boundary. If
you want to know why I call it so I can only say that
once you have crossed it things are different; I do not
mean a difference merely of country or scenery, but a
difference of atmosphere; better, and more literally, a
change of spirit. To put it bluntly, I never knew the
reality of fairyland until I blundered across that road
one grey gusty evening ten years ago, and heard the
tall grasses whistling in the wind. Since then the road
has always been a frontier, not to be crossed without
preparation.</p>

<p>As &ldquo;3.7&rdquo; tumbled out of his go-cart I looked at my
watch and saw it lacked but a few minutes to noon.
It was just such a cloudless June day as must have
inspired Shelley's <i>Hymn of Apollo</i>. No smallest cloud
to break the dazzling blue; and, high above our heads,
Apollo, standing &ldquo;at noon upon the peak of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it had been Midsummer Day I should have thought
twice about crossing the Boundary. As it was, we were
quite near enough to the 24th of June to make it risky.
So, as &ldquo;3.7&rdquo; bent a tangled head over the bonnet of
his Daimler, I flung myself down on the level turf
beside him and stared across the road.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg455" id="Pg455"></a>Behind us and on either side were clumps of gorse
bushes, and beyond them the immense level expanse
of the open heath. Immediately in front was the road,
sunk a foot beneath the turf, which comes right up to
it, both on this side and that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another piece of string, please,&rdquo; said &ldquo;3.7,&rdquo;
rummaging in my pockets without waiting for an
answer, &ldquo;and a pencil, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then I saw it. On the farther side of the road
there is a stretch of short turf, some hundred yards
wide; and beyond that an irregular line of silver birches;
and beyond that the blue of distant hills, for the
Common slopes down where the trees begin. Between
the silvery wood and the road, through the midst of the
wide belt of turf, and parallel with the Boundary, ran a
river. There was nothing to be much surprised at, for
it was just the kind of river you would expect to see
running through the fields of fairyland. It was a river
of grass.</p>

<p>It was the slender-stalked, tufted, not very tall, grey-headed
grass that grows quite generally in open country
and wild places. But the wind and the sun now turned
it into a river which ran fast between its banks of green,
its waves silvery grey, quick-flowing waves, gleaming
and dappled, an endless succession. It flowed from
somewhere out of sight in the west, and disappeared
to the east over the edge of the great slope that brings
you down to the woods, vanishing, to all intents and
purposes, over the edge of the world.</p>

<p>Without taking my eyes off this astonishing spectacle
I stretched out a hand and, catching &ldquo;3.7&rdquo; by the
edge of his white smock, told him to run across the
road to the grass and&mdash;paddle in it. I said it was
better than motor cars. He made no comment on this
but, after glancing warily up and down the road (for
he has been brought up in wholesome awe of the entire
tribe of automobiles), he crossed the Boundary, ran
across the turf and plunged up to his knees in the river.</p>

<p>I cannot be certain, but it is my considered opinion
that Apollo stopped his golden chariot for the space of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg456" id="Pg456"></a>a whole minute to look down at the golden-haired boy
wading in that noiseless, fast-flowing river.</p>

<p>In another minute &ldquo;3.7&rdquo; was back at my side, both
hands full of the tufted grass he had pulled. I regret
to say he tickled my ear with it.</p>



<p class="break">Honest, solemn reader, ardent food reformer, keen
educationist, clear-headed moralist, practical-minded
housewife, I tell you frankly there is no moral to this
little episode. It throws no light on what to eat, or on
the purchasing power of an English shilling, or on the
ethical training of young children, or on the nature of
neurasthenia. Fairyland, of course, is a childish fiction,
Apollo a solar myth, a road is a road, grass is grass
and heaven is a state of mind. I quite agree with you.
But let me whisper something in your ear. If you
should ever blunder across your Boundary, don't be
surprised if things look queer on the other side; above
all, whatever you do, don't let any strange river you
may find flowing there carry you away, or it may bring
you, spite of all your protests, through one of the gates
of pearl into the City of God.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SCIENTIFIC_BASIS_FOR_MENTAL_HEALING" id="A_SCIENTIFIC_BASIS_FOR_MENTAL_HEALING"></a>A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR
MENTAL HEALING.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>here is a vast amount of loose talk, and innumerable
assertions from irresponsible individuals
concerning the wonders that have been
achieved by Mental Healing, but naturally the scientist
and physician, when dealing with such a question
as this, has to put aside, not all enthusiasm, but
certainly all emotionalism, and then, most carefully sift
the evidence laid before him. The scientist here wants
hard, dry, irrefutable facts; the responsible physician
requires to know&mdash;by his own careful diagnosis or by
an array of tabulated facts&mdash;the condition of the patient
before and after treatment&mdash;that is, of the one who
claims to have been cured by mental means. Innumer<a class="pagenum" name="Pg457" id="Pg457"></a>able
claims are thus being made by patients and others,
so that it is imperative for the unbiased physician at all
events to consider the above question; this in order to
give a reason for the faith that is in him, when he is
known to be one of those who favour the metaphysical
means of healing. Even the sciolist in the matter
knows that in the case, say, of blushing, or blanching
of the face, the action of mind over matter&mdash;of the
body&mdash;is palpable; all admit that the quality of joy, for
instance, will prove a splendid tonic; that despair, on
the other hand, will pull down the bodily condition.
But all this, we shall be told, is unconscious action;
true, but fortunately we are now aware that by a
forceful action of the will we can <i>consciously</i> direct or
derivate, as the case may be, currents of nerve-force
to any part of the body. Occultists have known this
for many centuries. Joy, hope, faith: these are very
potent factors in improving the health conditions&mdash;simply
because they act upon the sympathetic nervous
system, and this latter acts upon the circulation.
Happiness dilates the blood-vessels. Fear contracts
them. Thus, unbounded faith; renewed hope; sudden
joy; enforced will-power; all have a marked effect upon
bringing about an equilibriated condition of the circulation&mdash;just
the same as a hot bath does, though not so
rapidly or so perceptibly. Further, we must remember
that all disease more or less is a stasis, a congestion,
somewhere; we have only to dissipate this; to separate
the cells; to expand the part, as it were, and &ldquo;resolution,&rdquo;
as we call it in congestion of the lungs, takes
place. So that it seems to me that we can fairly claim
a strictly scientific basis for Mental Healing. I have
always, however, maintained that the attitude of the
patient's own mind has much to do with the result: in
his consciousness there must be faith and hope in order
to get the best effect.</p>

<p>Judging, then, of the very remarkable and palpable
changes which anyone can see occur on such superficial
parts as the face and extremities, I can see no reason
that, by an enforced mental action, the deeper parts&mdash;<a class="pagenum" name="Pg458" id="Pg458"></a>including
any hidden diseased part&mdash;should not be
altered for good. I am very confident that it is upon
these lines, coupled, as they can always be, with advice
as to clean feeding and right living generally, the
physician of the future will largely depend for his cures.
Thus we are fully justified in not only trying the system
on &ldquo;functional,&rdquo; but also for &ldquo;organic,&rdquo; cases.</p>

<h3><a name="Fasting1" id="Fasting1"></a><span class="smcap">Account of a Fast, undertaken for the Cure of a Profound
Blood Disease.</span></h3>


<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he following account of a fast is worthy of attention. It
is rigidly accurate <i>in principle</i>, as far as I could make it
so, and I am responsible for its truthfulness. But the
subject of it, feeling that he is engaged in a duty and &ldquo;labour of
love,&rdquo; as he expresses it, is yet naturally anxious to prevent his
identity from being discovered; and so, while the facts of the
narrative are true in principle they have been varied in a few
details for the purpose of preventing the recognition of the subject
of them.</p>

<p>They occurred in the history of a man of about 40 years of age,
who fell ill of an infectious disease some 20 years ago, while living
abroad. The exact time of the infection is not known. The
patient was treated by qualified doctors living in the same country
as himself, and there is no reason to believe that he was not
properly and skilfully treated. He had, however, for years
buoyed himself up with the hope that he should be able to come
to England for the best treatment, and recently he found himself
in this country for that purpose. It goes without saying that the
eminent men consulted treated him after the most modern and
approved methods, which were also, so far as knowledge goes, the
most likely to benefit him. Not only as to treatment must it be
assumed that the best was done, but the diagnosis also is supported
by the authority of the doctors seen, and was confirmed by
physiological and pathological investigation. This would be
recognised if it were possible to publish names, places and dates
which are withheld from the courteous reader for the reason
already given. I can only say that I entirely concur in the
diagnosis and in the suitability of the treatment.</p>

<p>The man came under my care on a Sunday, the fast, which is
the subject matter of this communication, having been commenced
on the Friday six weeks before that day, the last food having been
taken on the Thursday at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I saw him, therefore, on the
forty-fifth day of the fast. His pulse was 59, soft, steady, regular.
Temp. 96.8 degrees, about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> He was able to be up, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg459" id="Pg459"></a>walked actively, all his bodily movements being active and his
mind quite clear and rational. His weight on the day after I first
saw him was, in the same clothes as when weighed at the
beginning of the fast, 129&frac12; lbs. He said he weighed 171 lbs. on the
machine at the commencement, and therefore the loss of bodily
weight up to that time was 41.5 lbs. The average loss of weight
during the 46 days of the fast was about nine-tenths of a pound
daily if the 41.5 lbs. loss is divided by the 46 days of the continuance
of the fast up to that time&mdash;41.5/46&nbsp;=&nbsp;.9 lbs. almost exactly.</p>

<p>When he came to my consulting room on the forty-sixth day,
about 2.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the pulse was 64, temp. 95.6 degrees (thermometer
3 minutes under tongue). He was much troubled with a nasty
expectoration of mucus. His breath was very offensive. No
enlarged glands could be felt in either groin&mdash;perhaps a trifling
enlargement in the right. In middle of front border of right tibia
a little irregularity is felt, and a small hollow, which he thinks is
filling up; but it might be that the exudation on the bone immediately
above and below the hollow is somewhat reduced, as this
would equally give the suggestion that the hollow is filling up.
There is a similar but rather smaller irregularity on the left tibia
also. He felt rather weak that day, which he attributed to not
having had his usual walk the day before. The nasal cavity
consists of a large grey septumless cavern showing dry crusts.
The issuing breath is most offensive. Patient had drunk freely of
water, he said, to the extent of 4 or 5 quarts a day during the
fast but when I said&mdash;do you mean that you have been taking
over a gallon of water daily?&mdash;he rather hesitated, and did not
think it was so much as that. He had not measured it and
had taken it cold usually, though occasionally hot, and had taken
it without stint as he wanted it. On the forty-eighth day of the
fast he complained of being weak but worst of all, he said, his
breath was very offensive to himself. It was so to me also&mdash;faint,
fetid, putrid. His sense of smell was greatly impaired, so much
so that he could not smell the offensiveness of the bowel-excreta
which came away every day on using the gravitation-enema, and
which were horrible to by-standers. It would seem from this as if
his distress at the bad smell of his breath was probably due to a
perversion of the sense of smell, which can be easily understood if
we reflect that the disease-process was going on in the region
where the smell-apparatus is specially located. The temperature
was 96.2 degrees that morning the patient said. At 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> when I
saw him the pulse was 68, regular, even, steady. He says he was
feverish last night. I suppose he felt hot. He sleeps well, but says
he hears the clogs of the mill-hands as they go to their work
in the mornings. Has lost 2 lbs. weight in last 2 days. Temp.
93.6 degrees to my observation 2.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Says he feels &ldquo;done at
the stomach.&rdquo; His voice is poor. Expectorates somewhat freely.
A small blob of green thickish mucus in ordinary white mucus
came away in my presence. Urine acid 1010. No glucose. Faint
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg460" id="Pg460"></a>trace of albumin to heat and picric acid: also to nitric acid. The
right lachrymal punctum is blocked; the tears run down the
cheek; and I failed to get even a hair-thick wire into it. Evening,
pulse 65, temp. 97.2 degrees in bed with hot-water bottle. F&aelig;ces
most offensive, no bowel-excreta coming away except to enema.
Forty-ninth day. In bed, temp. 97.2 degrees, pulse 65, soft, steady,
regular. No great emaciation of limbs. Showed me some green
expectoration. He says it is from Salvarsan as it is exactly like
what he was injected with! The motion to the enema as offensive
as before, but the breath is less offensive to me: not so fetid.</p>

<p>On this day patient completed 7 weeks of fasting. Feels sick
and as if he would vomit. About midday he did vomit about
a teaspoonful of dark green stuff, very bitter and acid (bile, I
should call it, though he calls it &ldquo;pure citric acid&rdquo;) and
immediately after that he got rid of a motion without the use
of the enema, brown, dark and very offensive still. I think the
breath, however, is rather less offensive; and so I thought also
two days ago. Temp. 97, pulse 67, soft, steady, regular; about
1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> In bed since fiftieth day of fast. Not feeling very ill
and not specially emaciated, though the buttocks are thinning;
but legs and thighs and arms and forearms not specially thin.
He came to me to be weighed on the forty-ninth day and weighed
127&frac12; lbs. Fifty-second day of fast. Still in bed. Condition much
the same as to pulse, temperature, etc., and as to emaciation
so far as observation goes. Remained in bed, not because unable
to be up, but because he thought it would be better for him to
be resting. On the fifty-fourth day, as he still felt sick, I gave
him, at his request, an emetic in the form of 10 grains of copper-sulphate.
This was followed by <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'sickeness'.">sickness</ins> after about an hour,
when he got rid of a very little of the same green stuff as
before. Bile? But the difficulty is to understand how, after all
this time of fasting, he should still feel sick and with inclination
to vomit. On the fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth days of the fast he
remained in bed, the condition being much the same. On Thursday,
the fifty-sixth day, he broke the fast at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, just 8 weeks
after beginning it. He had meant to go on for 60 days, and I
did not think that there would have been any danger in his
doing so; but I did not press him to continue any longer. He
took 3 oranges on that day; and on the Friday he took 5 more.
I advised him not to increase the quantity of food too quickly.
The breath has been quite sweet during the last two days. He
has been too weak to take enemata, so we cannot say if motions
would still have been offensive. And as there is no weighing
machine in his room, we don't know the exact loss of weight
sustained during the fast, though there is no reason to think that
it has averaged more than .9 lb. a day. Up to the time of
stopping the enemata, pieces of mucous membrane and mucus
itself came away from the bowel, and the motions were very
offensive. He seems to have a mucous enteritis without fever.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after breaking the fast, patient took 6
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg461" id="Pg461"></a>oranges, 4 apples and a banana; and he ordered much more food,
which, however, I advised him not to take. On this day his
bowels were opened naturally, with a very offensive motion.
But the breath was much sweeter, in fact not offensive at all.</p>

<p>On the sixth day he came to my consulting-room and weighed
128 lbs. Pulse 80, soft, steady, regular. He had not slept all
night and had had to be up no fewer than 6 times to have his
bowels opened. No diarrh&oelig;a, he said, but full motions, the first
3 very offensive. Breath not offensive. Has dry pharyngitis and
is complaining of sore throat.</p>

<p>Next day. Weight 133 lbs. Bowels acted again, 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Large motions. I told him I thought
he was taking too much food. Pulse 104. Not sleeping well.
Complained of sore throat.</p>

<p>Eighth day. Weight 138 lbs., a gain of 5 lbs. a day for 2 days.
Pulse 80 at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> (his own statement), at 2.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> pulse 100,
temp. 99.4 degrees. Bowels acted at 12 midnight, 3.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Went that day to have his photograph taken.
The throat was better. Tongue dry and leathery. It was plain
to me that he was taking too much food. He was having a
mixed diet and taking much and often. He said his &ldquo;mouth was
coming to pieces,&rdquo; and in fact the mucous membrane was glazed
and peeling; also the lips. On the ninth day he returned home.</p>

<p>The loss of weight can be seen from the following statement.
On commencing the fast the weight was 171 lbs.</p>

<p>Fast ended on fifty-sixth day. On the sixth day after breaking
the fast the weight was 128 lbs. On the next day it had risen
to 133 lbs. and on the following day to 138 lbs. In the first 47
days of the fast the loss of weight was 43.5 lbs., or an average
loss of .888 lbs. daily (43.5/49&nbsp;=&nbsp;.888 lbs.) The loss of weight for
the last 8 days before the fast was broken is not known as
patient was in bed, though it probably was at much the same rate
as during the other times of the fast when the weight was taken
on the scales.</p>

<p>The following comparative measurements are interesting. Of
course he had been eating for a week after the termination of
his fast, so that the measurements taken on that day would be
higher probably than if they had been taken seven days before,
when he broke the fast.</p>

<p>Patient kept a diary during his fast, but it does not seem
necessary to reproduce its statements here. It shows that he
walked about during the time, notes the state of the weather as
foggy or very foggy or freezing, mentions that water was taken,
sometimes hot apparently, as on 15th March, &ldquo;after glass of
hot water, pulse 70, temperature 98&frac12; degrees.&rdquo; No doubt
drinking the hot water had elevated temporarily the mouth-temperature,
as it does. The diary also notes that he felt weak,
had a bath, or did not have a bath, notes the pulse-rate, etc., as
also the effects of the daily enemata. On the twenty-ninth day
of the fast he took a bottle of Apenta Water. Such are samples
of statements from the diary.</p>

<h3><a name="Salads" id="Salads"></a><span class="smcap">Salads and Salad Dressings.</span></h3>


<p>For salads it is not necessary to depend entirely upon
the usual salad vegetables such as lettuce, watercress,
mustard and cress.</p>

<p>The very finely shredded hearts of raw brussel
sprouts are excellent, and even the heart of a savoy
cabbage. Then the finely chopped inside sticks of a
tender head of celery are very good; also young
spinach leaves, dandelion leaves, endive, sorrel and
young nasturtium leaves.</p>

<p>Then there are the onion family (for those who can
take them), the tender kinds, such as spring onion,
chive and shallot being very good when chopped finely
and used as a minor ingredient in any salad.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg463" id="Pg463"></a>The root vegetables should also be added in their
season, raw carrot, turnip, beet, artichoke and leek,
all finely grated.</p>

<p>A taste for all the above-mentioned vegetables, eaten
raw, is not acquired all at once. It is best to begin
by making the salad of the ingredients usually preferred
and mixing in a small quantity of one or two of the
new ingredients.</p>

<p>For those who find salads very difficult to digest, it
is best to begin with French or cabbage lettuce and
skinned tomatoes only, or, as an alternative, a saucerful
of watercress chopped very finely, as one chops
parsley.</p>

<p>Any salad, however made up, should be served in
as dainty and pleasing a fashion as possible. It is,
perhaps, usually best to serve it ready chopped and
shredded, and to allow each person at the table to take
his or her own helping of &ldquo;dressing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>English people seldom serve salad in the French
fashion&mdash;that is, quite dry, save that the dressing is
well mixed in an hour before the meal. Readers who
have been to France may have seen French peasant
women whirling a wire salad-basket round their heads
in order to dry the materials after the cleansing has been
done. When dry, the green-stuff is torn with the hands,
the dressing (and the French know all about salad
dressings) is added and the whole allowed to stand
some little time, so that by the time the meal is served
there is a complete blending of all flavours.</p>

<p>Not everyone likes this method; but it is certainly
better than the customary method here, which too often
leaves a little puddle of water at the bottom of the
bowl.</p>

<p>There are many ways of preparing good salad dressing
without resort to vinegar, salt and pepper. The two
prime necessities are (1) really good oil and (2) some
kind of fresh fruit juice. Most people prefer lemon
juice or the juice of fresh West Indian limes, well mixed
into either olive oil, nut oil or a blended oil such as the
&ldquo;Protoid Fruit Oil&rdquo; or Mapleton's Salad Oil. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg464" id="Pg464"></a>ordinary &ldquo;salad oils&rdquo; obtainable at grocers are seldom
to be recommended; they almost invariably contain
chemical preservatives and other adulterants. It is
better to have the best oil and use it sparingly if need be,
than take any faked product just because it is cheap.</p>

<p>With most people the addition of pure oil assists the
digestion of the salad, as well as serving other purposes
in the body.</p>

<p>Many excellent salad recipes and suggestions for
novel yet simple &ldquo;dressings&rdquo; will be found in <i>Unfired
Food in Practice</i>, by Stanley Gibbon.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Malaria" id="Malaria"></a>CAN MALARIA BE PREVENTED?</h3>

<blockquote><p>A. de L. (Lisbon) writes:&mdash;For five months I have been a strict
&ldquo;fruitarian,&rdquo; and as I am obliged now to go to Mozambique
(Portuguese East Africa) to remain there five rears, I should be
much obliged to you if you kindly let me know what I must do
to prevent the African fever and biliousness which seem to afflict
all Europeans in that part of the world. Any hints you could give
me as to maintaining health in such a climate would be most
gratefully acknowledged.</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not think that it is possible for any European,
whether he adopts fruitarian or ordinary diet, to entirely
escape malaria, since it is caused by a minute parasite
which is forced into the blood by a certain form of biting
mosquito.</p>

<p>The parasite will, however, surely gain less hold on
one whose blood is clean and pure and whose vital
force is strong, than on one who dissipates his strength
by partaking of meat, alcohol, tea, coffee and other
stimulants, or who otherwise gets his blood into a bad
state by faulty diet generally.</p>

<p>Therefore, the thing this correspondent should do is
to live as much as possible upon the simple frugal fare
of the natives. He can take raw coker-nut freely and
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg467" id="Pg467"></a>eat the fresh fruits which grow in this part of Africa.
If he can obtain pineapple or papaw he will find these
excellent to help him to retain his health and strength
in this country.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Child" id="Child"></a>UNFIRED DIET FOR A CHILD: IS IT SUITABLE?</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs L.B.F. writes:&mdash;My husband and I are much interested
in <i>The Healthy Life</i>, deriving much benefit and good advice from
its pages. It is the only magazine, we find, which answers
questions that we have long been puzzling over. Reading a work
of the &ldquo;Montessori Method&rdquo; of training children last night I was
disturbed to find I had, according to that book, been feeding my
little boy, aged three years, all wrong. It says: &ldquo;Raw vegetables
should not be given to a child and not many cooked ones. Nuts,
dates, figs and all dried fruits should be withheld. Soups made
with bread, oil, bread and butter, milk, eggs, etc., are the
principal foods Dr Montessori recommends. She also advocates
the use of sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our boy has nuts, ground and whole, all the fresh fruits and
dried ones, salads, brown bread and nut butter, sometimes dairy
butter, no milk, his food mostly uncooked, as we ourselves
believe in. If Dr Valentine Knaggs would give us his opinion
on this I should be very grateful. The boy is healthy, but I notice
a slight puffiness below the eyes of late in the morning. Also his
temper does not improve as he gets older. Will he be having too
much proteid (nuts) for one of his years, or is the temper natural
as a result of bad discipline. His father is away all day, and
mothers are, as a rule, soft marks, are they not?</p></blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to answer fully a question of this sort,
as so much depends on the child's temperament and
environment. A frail, delicate child with the promise of
high mental development requires a finer and softer
grade of nutriment than one of a coarse animal nature
with strong, well-developed digestive organs.</p>

<p>All healthy children, especially boys (as Mr Saxon
will attest!), are full of mischief and restlessness, which
it is the duty of a mother or a nurse to divert into right
channels.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The display of temper is probably an indication
of this not being done, though it <i>may</i> be due in
part to the raw diet not suiting the child.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a> This correspondent, and all mothers of difficult children, should
study the works of Mary Everest Boole, published by C.W.
Daniel, Ltd.; also <i>The Children All Day Long</i>, by E.M.
Cobham.&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg468" id="Pg468"></a>The advice I would give would be to alter the diet
and make it lighter.</p>

<p>From my point of view, Dr Montessori has not given
sufficient attention to the other side of the diet question,
preferring to remain more on the side of orthodoxy.
Moreover, her own work has been done in Italy, where
a climate prevails which does not call for so free a use
of vegetables and salads as is the case in our own
cooler and bleaker clime.</p>

<p>I suggest, as a beginning, the following diet might
be tried, but it is necessarily impossible to guarantee
good results unless the cause of the puffy eyes and
temper have been definitely located by personal examination:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;A raw ripe apple, finely grated, or simply
scraped out with a silver spoon.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast at 8.</i>&mdash;A scrambled egg on a Granose
biscuit with a little finely chopped salad or finely grated;
raw roots appetisingly served with a dressing of oil,
lemon juice and a little honey. This to be followed by
an &ldquo;Ixion&rdquo; or &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; biscuit, with fresh butter.</p>

<p><i>Dinner at 2.</i>&mdash;Home-made cottage cheese, or cream
cheese, or a nut meat (served cold out of the tin, or,
better still, home-made). Two casserole-cooked vegetables,
done with a little fruit juice and lemon to retain
colour. This to be followed by a baked apple with
cream and a little home-made, unfired pudding made
of dried fruits.</p>

<p><i>Supper at 5.</i>&mdash;A slice of &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo; bread, and
butter, and a cupful of clear vegetable soup, or some
hot water with some lemon juice added, and slightly
sweetened with a little honey.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Giddiness" id="Giddiness"></a>GIDDINESS AND HEAD TROUBLE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs L.B.F. also writes:&mdash;I sometimes think I must make
dietetic mistakes. My husband thinks I am perfectly healthy, so
I do not say anything of the giddiness in the morning and after
eating, a drowsiness and slight pain at the back of the head and
underneath one of my ears. Also under my eyes is on some
mornings quite swollen and puffed up. It is not so marked, but
I am quite conscious of it. Our diet consists mostly of a salad,
with bread or baked potato and cheese or ground nuts or cooked
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg469" id="Pg469"></a>brussels sprouts and a nut meat pie, apple pie and cream, with
brown bread and butter, or a raw fruit meal, nuts, apples, grapes,
figs, dates and no bread.</p>

<p>Two meals a day, first in the morning at eight o'clock, second
at two or three in the afternoon. A glass of hot water with
lemon at nine <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and the same in the morning. I do some
exercises night and morning and am out in the fresh air often
through the day. We live in the country and I have every chance
of keeping myself healthy. Perhaps I should say I do not eat
many nuts, finding them rather difficult to digest. Should I use
an enema when I feel like this, or wait for natural results?</p></blockquote>

<p>The symptoms of which L.B.F. complains are in all
probability due to flatulence and to general disturbances
of the digestive process.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be a good plan to make the diet
lighter. The nuts could be omitted and cheese or eggs
substituted. An evening meal would be helpful.</p>

<p>As to the bowels, some senna and camomile tea at
bedtime would help to clear them. Unless there is
distinct evidence of f&aelig;cal retention in the colon it is
better not to use the enema as a regular thing.</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;A tumblerful of Sanum Tonic Tea made
with hot, preferably distilled, water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;An all-fruit meal consisting of nothing
but apples, bananas, grapes, or orange, or any fresh
ripe fruit that is in season.</p>

<p><i>Dinner at 12.30.</i>&mdash;A cooked meal consisting of two
casserole-cooked vegetables, with grated cheese as a
sauce dressing, with some twice-baked or well toasted
bakers' bread, followed by a baked apple and cream.
(Omit nut meat pie and apple pie.)</p>

<p><i>Tea meal at 5.</i>&mdash;2 oz. of cottage cheese or cream
cheese, wholemeal bread and butter, small plateful of
finely grated raw roots with an appetising dressing
containing some &ldquo;Protoid Fruit-Oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bedtime.</i>&mdash;Tumblerful of hot water (preferably distilled)
to which senna leaves and German camomile
flowers (very little) have been steeped to infuse; or a
cupful of dandelion coffee could be taken if the bowels
are regularly acting.</p>

<blockquote><p>W.T. writes:&mdash;Having tried a diet, recommended in <i>The
Healthy Life</i>, for a month I find the nuts and cheese are far too
heavy for the apparent weak condition of my stomach, also that
the salads and casserole-baked vegetables are too irritating to
the membrane of the stomach. I have no desire to return to
flesh food and ordinary feeding, which I feel would not be good
for me. From eggs I cannot obtain any good results. The
continuance of loss of weight is worrying me, being down to
eight stone from eleven stone in twelve months. I feel satisfied
it is only a question of diet, if I could only strike the correct
one. I am naturally most anxious to regain some of my lost
strength and weight. I am at present taking bread and butter,
cooked fruit, and occasionally an egg, boiled rice, vegetables and
a little dried fruit. No matter how light I make my diet I still
suffer after every meal with dilated stomach and irregular working
of the heart. Blood circulation is still bad and constipation
is gradually getting worse. As before stated, I am anxious to
succeed with the reformed diet, but I am really at a loss to
know which way to proceed to make any progress. As I was
in South Africa twenty years, and only returned to England just
before this catarrh set in, is the climate here against my progress,
do you think? I am so sorry to take up so much of your time,
but shall be grateful for any help you can give me which will be
greatly appreciated.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to advise how best to proceed in this
case as our correspondent really ought to seek medical
advice. Only in this way can he obtain really satisfactory
guidance. For without knowing the state of
his blood and the organs generally it is impossible to
advise correctly. Speaking generally, until salads and
casserole-cooked vegetables can be taken freely there
can be no possible permanent cure.</p>

<p>In many such cases the best way to train the digestive
organs into a healthy state is to keep to a diet consisting
chiefly of dextrinised cereals, which must be eaten dry,
with some vegetables and as little fresh fruit as possible.
This to be continued until little by little the raw salad
vegetables are found to agree; then the rest is easy.</p>

<p>A diet on the following lines would probably be a
good temporary measure:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;One egg lightly boiled, poached or
baked, with two Granose biscuits and fresh butter,
eaten dry.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg471" id="Pg471"></a><i>Dinner.</i>&mdash;Brusson Jeune bread (one or two rolls) with
butter, and small helping of vegetables, cooked at <i>first</i>
in the orthodox way.</p>

<p><i>Supper.</i>&mdash;Plateful of boiled rice (cooked dry in the
Indian fashion<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) with a tablespoonful of good malt
extract.</p>

<p>No sugar, honey, stewed fruit, or dried fruit should
be taken until improvement has set in. As little fluid
as possible should be taken until the stomach has
regained more tone and become more normal in size.</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Catarrh" id="Catarrh"></a>SEVERE DIGESTIVE CATARRH.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Miss S.L.P. writes:&mdash;I should like a little help as to diet. I
have just had an attack of epidemic influenza with throat trouble,
so that I feel very much run down and unfit for a diet too
depleting in character. For over four years I have adopted a
non-flesh diet on account of a tendency to chronic catarrh of the
whole alimentary tract, due to rheumatic tendencies which affect
me internally rather than externally. The continuous damp
weather has produced much gastric irritation, and frequent
acidity.</p>

<p>I cannot discover a diet that is convenient and at the same
time sufficiently nourishing. I lose flesh on what I take, and
I have none to spare, though at one time I was inclined to be
stout. My age is forty-eight.</p>

<p>I take three meals a day. A light breakfast either of &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo;
bread or &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; Cracker biscuits and butter, with
tomato or fresh fruit or occasionally an egg. For midday meal
an egg or milled cheese, or nuts or cream cheese, with a baked
potato and a conservatively cooked vegetable. Occasionally I
have a little salad and grated carrot, but unless I am better than
usual I cannot digest these. The evening meal consists of
&ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo; bread or &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; Cracker biscuits or Granose
flakes, with cream cheese. As a child I suffered constantly from
colds in the head, but now my troubles are oftener internal.</p>

<p>The action of the bowels is irregular. I depend chiefly upon
an enema of warm water when constipation is present.</p>

<p>I never drink tea, only hot water, or Emprote and water, or
occasionally vegetable juices or fruit juices. I find I am better
without much fluid.</p></blockquote>

<p>So far as it is possible to judge from this letter, this
correspondent is suffering not only from stomach and
bowel catarrh, but her condition as a whole is unsatisfactory.
The vital force is depleted and the nervous
system is not doing efficient work.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg472" id="Pg472"></a>She needs suitable treatment to remove the acid and
toxins with which the system is evidently clogged.
This is not an easy task, for as soon as elimination
begins trouble arises in the form of influenza or other
similar derangements. These are probably little else
but attempts on the part of nature to rouse the vital
force of the body into action with a view to clearing
out the clogging poisons.</p>

<p>Waste clearing should be done gradually. The skin
should be made to act better by means of home Turkish
baths, or by wet-sheet packs. Then mustard poultices
can be applied <i>along the course of the spine</i> and massage
with suitable manipulations can be applied to the
muscles and bones which make up the spine. The daily
practising of the excellent and simple breathing and
bending exercises described in M&uuml;ller's <i>My System for
Ladies</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> will be very helpful. By means such as these
the body will be gradually cleared of its poisons, and
so the nervous system will be made to do better work.</p>

<p>The diet specified can be continued.</p>

<h2><a name="AN_INDICATION25" id="AN_INDICATION25"></a>AN INDICATION.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he pursuit of health, considered from the
negative standpoint, is the flight from pain.</p>

<p>And pain is the great mystery of life.</p>

<p>James Hinton, himself a well-known physician
of his time, attempted to solve the mystery of pain
by showing that it is the accompaniment of imperfection.
That what is now experienced as pain
might be exquisite pleasure given a higher stage
of human development.</p>

<p>But this, after all, only shifts the mystery one
step farther. Instead of the mystery of pain we
have the mystery of imperfection. Yet to image
perfection is always to image something incapable
of growth or further development.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a perfect circle. So long as
it remains unbroken, flawless, the line (or infinite
number of lines) composing it cannot be continued
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg474" id="Pg474"></a>or extended. But given a break in the line and it
may be continued round and round, up and up
(or down and down) into an infinitely ascending
spiral. This possibility of extension depends on
a break, on an imperfection.</p>

<p>It does not follow, of course, that every flaw in
human nature is always the starting-point of new
growth, every failure a stepping-stone to greater
knowledge, but the possibility is there. It is for
men to see that they do not neglect their opportunities.&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>




<h2><a name="IMAGINATION_IN_PLAY" id="IMAGINATION_IN_PLAY"></a>IMAGINATION IN PLAY.</h2>


<p><i>Regular readers will recognise in this wonderfully simple and
suggestive article a continuation of the series previously entitled
&ldquo;Healthy Brains.&rdquo; The author of &ldquo;The Children All Day Long&rdquo;
is an intimate disciple of one of the greatest living psychologists,
and she has a message of the first importance to all who realise
that true health depends as much on poise of mind as on physical
fitness.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">T</span>he fruit of imagination ripens into deeds actually
done in the service of man: its flower brightens
the whole of life and makes it fragrant, from the
budding-time of children's play and laughter to the
developed blossoms of the creative imagination which
we call painting or poetry or music.</p>

<p>Play and art have this in common, that they are
activities pursued for the sake of the activity itself, not
as a means to any other object, not aiming at any
material usefulness. Actually, of course, there is nothing
more useful, on every scale of usefulness, than
the development of the individual in art or play, but
these would never be really themselves while an ulterior
purpose formed a background to them in consciousness.</p>

<p>Physical exercises devised for the sake of health are
a more or less pleasant form of work; they do not take
the place of play. Our ordinary work is usually more
or less one-sided and unbalanced in the demands it
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg475" id="Pg475"></a>makes upon us; we therefore try to find what other
set of movements will undo this unbalancement and give
us back unbiased bodies. When that is done, and not
till then, we get freedom, and it is at that <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'movement' but the misprint is corrected in the next issue (page 510).">moment</ins>
that real &ldquo;play&rdquo; begins&mdash;the use of the freed muscles
according to our own will and pleasure.</p>

<p>The same thing is perhaps true in connection with our
minds. We all see the fallacy of the old-fashioned
hustlers' cry, &ldquo;Make your work your hobby; think
of nothing else; let every moment be subordinated to
the dominating idea of your career; put aside all sentimentalism,
all laziness and self-will, all enthusiasm
about things not in your own line of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have come to see that this kind of effort leads
often to nervous breakdown and early death; always
to a certain narrowing of sympathy and hardening of
method even in the career itself. So we conscientiously
&ldquo;take up&rdquo; a hobby or a sport and set aside some hour
or day for indulgence in it. We make it a duty to lay
aside for the time being all idea of duties; part of our
work is to learn to rest.</p>

<p>So far so good. But does all this go far enough?</p>

<p>Work imposed by any set of outer needs puts the
whole being under a certain strain. The aim of remedial
exercises, prescribed rest-times and legal holidays is to
undo this strain, to unwind us from our coil by twisting
us the other way.</p>

<p>When this has been satisfactorily done, too often the
person responsible thinks that this is enough. But it
is really and truly at this moment that one is beginning
one's real life.</p>

<p>When the body is freed from strain and weariness
is the time to leap and dance and sing and wrestle.</p>

<p>When the mind is free from prejudice and weariness
is the time for its original activity to begin; new
thoughts spring up unbidden and the creative <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'admiration' but the misprint is corrected in the next issue (page 510).">imagination</ins>
lives and grows.</p>

<p>(In the sphere of will, many great sages have said
that an analogous sequence holds good. When the
whole emotional and moral nature has thrown itself in
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg476" id="Pg476"></a>a particular direction, and then an unwinding has taken
place, the moment of completed renunciation has been
said to be the dawn of some great new spiritual light.)</p>

<p>Who does not know the peaceful activity of a Sunday
evening, the fruitful quiet of a long railway journey or
sea-voyage <i>at the end</i> of a holiday? Two friends walk
slowly home together after an exciting expedition or
debate; two girls give each other their confidence while
brushing their hair after a dance.</p>

<p>Why is this so? Nowadays people are very ready to
answer the question by refusing the fact. It is waste
of time not to be <i>doing</i> something strenuously. Rest
is almost as strenuous as everything else; it is to be
thorough while it is the duty on hand and is to fit
exactly on to the work time, without overlapping but
without interspace.</p>

<p>In this way too often the imagination, the really
individual part of the mind, is starved and atrophied.
Especially in childhood there ought to be a space left
between useful work and ordered play for the individually
invented games, the pursuits that are not for any
definite end, for dreams and lived-out tales, when the
child may make what he likes, do what he likes,
and in imagination be what he likes. If we scrupulously
respected this growing-time we should soon
have a race of sturdier mettle altogether. Just now
this particular want is probably most nearly supplied
among elementary school children than among those
who have more &ldquo;educational advantages&rdquo;; they &ldquo;go
out to play&rdquo; in the streets for hours every day, and
one cannot help thinking that it is the vitality thus
evolved that keeps most of them healthy and happy in
spite of many hardships.</p>

<p>In later life, if we really want to make something
of our lives, we shall do well to insist an keeping such
a margin of free time to ourselves. It need not be long.
Five minutes, if one really sails away in the ship of
imagination, will take us to fairyland and back again.
But the five minutes (or the day in the country, or the
week of quiet, or whatever we take or can get) must
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg477" id="Pg477"></a>really and truly be free; we must have the courage to
seek for what we really want, and we shall have the
inestimable reward of finding what we really are.</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">F</span>or some years I lived according to the advice
given by &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; with regard to the quantity
of proteid that should be taken. But experience
led me to believe that it was wrong. In recent years
my diet has consisted of the following quantities per
annum:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Three to four bushels of wheat.</li>
<li>Seventy pounds of oats.</li>
<li>One bushel of nuts (measured in the shells).</li>
</ul>

<p>And with these foods rich in proteid, I have taken
plenty of raw vegetables and fruit, and three to four
gallons of olive oil.</p>

<p>I do not mention this as an ideal, in order to suggest
another and better standard than that of &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; I do
not think any such thing as a standard really exists or
can exist. But I mention it to show how far I have
travelled away from where I was.</p>

<p>I take it that all food reformers will agree that the
main reason for food reform is to make the body a more
harmonious instrument for the true life of man, and
that carries with it the belief that there is some correspondence,
if we cannot yet see absolute unity, between
the physical and the spiritual. Now the law of life,
according to Christ, is one of continual progress towards
perfection and I do not see how this will harmonise with
the teaching of a fixed law for the body. All my experience
and observation point to a progressive law for the
body, and I do not know of a single fact contrary to it.</p>

<p>My first point, then, is that there is no such thing as
a standard of proteid needed by the body. All that can
be said is this, that if you take a man who has been
fed on a certain quantity for such and such a time and
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg478" id="Pg478"></a>then feed him on a certain other quantity, alterations
in the physical condition will appear. But who can say
whether these changes are attributable merely to a
deficiency or to a previous excess? If &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; and
his patients take excessive food they naturally get
trouble from stored poisons when they reduce the
quantity. But why put all the trouble down to present
deficiency instead of to previous excess? To this I can
find no satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>If we have got our bodies into so hopeless a condition
that we cannot use our God-given instincts, tastes and
feelings in the first place, the wisdom of troubling much
about the continuance of bodily life would be doubtful;
and, in the second place, one would need most overwhelming
signs of knowledge to substitute for them.
But where are they? There is no agreement between
those who have been taught physiology. On the one
hand, &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; gives a proteid standard, now impossible
to myself, and I believe to many others, for it
would involve eating a nauseating quantity; and, on the
other hand, another doctor, presumably acquainted with
the same physiology, tells me I cannot eat too little, so
long as I do not persistently violate true hunger and
taste. Then another doctor gives quite a different
standard, and a much lower one. If we discard our
natural guides, which of the claimants to knowledge
is to be followed, and is there any knowledge at all
such as is claimed?</p>

<p>Imagine what a mockery it would have been to give
such a standard as that of &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; to the agricultural
labourer about the middle of last century, a typical one
with a large family, and one who worked as men do not
work to-day, and had to rear his family on a few
shillings a week. How could such <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original has an apostrophe after the 'a'.">a</ins> one have provided
more than a fraction of what &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; says is necessary,
either for himself or his children?</p>

<p>The broad fact is, that all the hardest work of the
world has always been done by those who get the least
food. As one who has had some experience of labour,
I doubt if the workers could have done so much if it had
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg479" id="Pg479"></a>not been for a spare diet. Certain it is, that since they
have more to eat, they are much less inclined to work.</p>

<p>My contention, then, is that there is no fixed standard
of proteid needed by the body, but that the quantity
depends on the development that is in progress and is
only discoverable by the natural guides of appetite and
taste, ruled by reason and love of others. Moreover,
I contend that even if there were such a standard as
&ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; says physiology has found, it obviously is not
known.</p>

<p>I cannot help recognising in &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; one whom I
gratefully love and respect. He helped me on the road,
and now that I differ from him I do not forget it, and
I ask his forgiveness if I seem to be arrogant. He
thinks I cannot see what he sees because I am underfed,
and I think he cannot see what I see because he is
overfed. In a sense we are both right, and we form a
beautiful illustration of the different states of mind that
belong to different physical conditions. I urge the
laymen like myself not to be afraid of that musty old
ill-shaped monster called Science<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> when he is up against
the eternal truths that belong to every simple untutored
man. Shun the monster as you would a priest, to whom
he has a great likeness, and unite with me in a long
strong pull to get &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; out of the rut in which the
monster holds him, so that we may have him with us
on the road, for he carries much treasure and we cannot
do without him.</p>

<p class="sig">A.A. Voysey.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7">[7]</a> I do not wish to be misunderstood. No sane man despises
real science, but when the mixture of science and ignorance, which
usually stalks about in the name of science, wants to usurp our
heaven-born instincts we cannot but notice his ugly and monstrous
shape. It is the function of science, or a true knowledge of details,
to fill in the mosaic of the temple of wisdom, but the mosaic can
never be the structure itself and is only useful and good when it is
subservient to that structure and harmonious with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Food Questions.</span></h3>


<p><span class="firstletter">&ldquo;W</span>e have to consider,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the question of
what food to take and how to cook
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camping out,&rdquo; said Sylvia, &ldquo;ought to be a complete
holiday from the food bother. Why not live on
unfired food, such as tinned tongue, sardines and bottled
shrimps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Felix laughed a great laugh, and said:
&ldquo;Just try and do a thousand miles on sardines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Felix is Sylvia's brother, who has spent some twenty
years in America, travelling for weeks through country
that contained no people, and spending nearly two years
in a single journey to Dawson City and home again.
He plainly knows far more about bed-rock camping than
anyone else in the family and we allowed him to take
the floor for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing is bread.&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;because you
can't do without bread. You must take some yeast or
else some baking-powder with you to make it rise, or
you must bake it very quickly so that the steam aerates
it. You might take a Dutch oven with you, but it's
nothing like the Dutch oven that you know in this
country. It is an iron pot on three legs, with an iron
lid. You stand it in the fire and cover the lid with hot
brands and you can cook anything inside it&mdash;ducks and
chunks of venison, and bread of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr Freeman has barred the oven,&rdquo; said Sylvia,
&ldquo;and if we are not going a thousand miles from home
perhaps we can do without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; answered Felix. &ldquo;I only mention it
so that you can get hold of the general principle. You
can make very good bread in a frying-pan. You must
mix the dough up stiff so that when the pan is nearly
upright it won't tumble out. You fix the pan up with
a prop behind it so that the dough faces the fire, quite
close, and you draw some more fire behind it so that
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg481" id="Pg481"></a>the back is warmed as well. When it burns a good
crust on both sides it is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are flap-jacks,&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just pan-cakes made without eggs or milk,&rdquo; said
Felix. &ldquo;You mix a quart of flour with a tablespoonful
of baking-powder and put in water till it is just so thin
that when you take up a spoonful and let it drop back
you can see the shape of it for a few seconds before
it melts into the rest. You fry the batter in bacon fat
or butter just like pan-cakes, and the cakes are very

<p>&ldquo;That's a good tip for us,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and another
good thing to take is cuddy biscuits, a kind of captain's
biscuit. Soak them a few minutes in water or milk
and fry them. They're nice with tomatoes or anything,
or by themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg482" id="Pg482"></a>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; said Felix, and his tone said, &ldquo;Mebbe
not.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm only discussing general principles, and
you've got to work your own way out in the light of
them. I've known an outfit come away without a
frying-pan. How do you make bread then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had to give it up, and Felix went on: &ldquo;Open
your flour sack, turn down the edge like it is in a
baker's shop, make a little hole in the flour and pour
in water to make a pond. Mix in what flour you want
to use and get your dough into the shape of a snake,
wind it round a stick and cook it like that. You've got
your bread then like a French roll, and very good it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all liked the idea of making bread every day and
eating it hot. Here was something to be had in camp
that you could not get at home. And we liked the
idea of learning our cooking by means of first principles.
Whether we liked it or not, Felix liked talking about it,
and he began to grow anecdotal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I met a whole lot of men, ten
of them I should think, camped on a cold frosty night
with nothing to eat. They were trying to do a journey
of thirty miles on rough prairie and their horses were
tired and they could not get on. They had brought
their lunch and eaten it long ago, and they told me they
were starving. They had nothing to eat, nothing to
do any cooking with and no wood to make a fire with.
I never saw such hungry people. They were new
settlers just out from England and it was up to me to
do something for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have you got in that great waggon?&rsquo; I
asked. They told me they had some sacks of flour and
two frozen quarters of beef, but there was nothing to
cook it in and no wood to make a fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was any amount of cow-dung on the prairie,
and it was dry as chips. I set them collecting that and
soon enough had a fire. I filled a bucket with water
and put it on to boil. I chopped off some meat and
put it in. Then I made some dumplings and put them
in. You just put them into boiling water, you know,
and then they cook at once on the outside and don't
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg483" id="Pg483"></a>come to pieces. If they boil too much they get pappy,
and if not done through they're not good. Most dumplings
you eat in England are not done, but mine were
just right and those ten hungry men had just as good
a supper as anyone could wish for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the coffee you used to make,&rdquo; said
Sylvia. &ldquo;What horrible stuff it must have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very best coffee ever I drank,&rdquo; said Felix.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We used to make it in a pot that was nearly a yard
high. We never turned out the grounds, but let them
settle and put in a little more every time we made
coffee, till the pot was so full that it wouldn't hold any
more water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see anything against it,&rdquo; I said, when Sylvia
and Gertrude were both expressing their horror. &ldquo;There
is no tannin or other bad principle in coffee and you
never get anything worse out of it than you do at the
first soaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellows that work the logs on the river have
their own kind of coffee that they call drip coffee,&rdquo; said
Felix. &ldquo;They have a tall pot like ours was and they
tie the coffee in a sack above the water, so that the
water never touches it, but the steam goes up and
fetches it out in drops. They don't change the sack
every time, but keep adding coffee till it won't hold
any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moral of which is?&rdquo; said Basil, who had for
some time been growing impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there are plenty of ways of cooking an egg
besides frying it,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;and that a bit of
common-sense is about the best article you can take
with you out camping. Take your food as raw as you
can get it and know how to cook it. Also know a good
herb when you see it, and never overlook a chance of
getting a meal from the country that will save your
stores.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Food reformers will have their own opinion about a
diet of shrimps, sardines, tinned tongue and stale coffee
when camping out: the most important part of the
outfit is doubtless an adequate supply of common-sense.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><i>In the April and May numbers of the present year we
published an article by Mr Hereward Carrington entitled
&ldquo;Seasickness: How Caused, How Cured.&rdquo; The
following supplementary suggestions by the same well-known
writer will be useful to many readers.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">A</span> very good plan, when you think of undertaking
a voyage, is to begin to prepare for it several
days in advance. For three or four days, before
embarking, eat only very simple and somewhat laxative
foods&mdash;such as fruits&mdash;so as to open the bowels well
and tone up the system. This simple diet should be
followed for the first two or three days aboard&mdash;of
course not so rigidly, but taking care not to indulge in
many heavy, greasy dishes. Unfortunately, the food
on board is usually very rich and plentiful, and tempts
one to eat. If one suffers from seasickness, there is
not this same temptation, to be sure; but the malady
may certainly be warded off, in the majority of cases,
if only reasonable care be taken of the diet before and
during the voyage, and if instructions herein laid down
be followed.</p>

<p>As before stated, drugs are as a rule useless for the
cure of seasickness; but on occasion a &ldquo;seasick cure&rdquo;
of some kind may prove effective. The harm which
results from the drug may perhaps be more than
counterbalanced by the benefits which the system derives
from the cessation of seasickness. A preparation of this
kind which is very highly recommended by many
travellers is known as &ldquo;Antimermal,&rdquo; and though none
of these remedies are to be recommended with assurance,
this one&mdash;and perhaps one or two others&mdash;might
at least be tried, in cases of dire necessity, when
seasickness has already supervened.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the patient should
remain in the open air continuously, until all symptoms
of seasickness have paused. <i>Live</i> in your deck chair
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg485" id="Pg485"></a>until you feel quite well and able to get up and walk
round. Do not attempt to go downstairs into the
dining-saloon to meals, if you feel in the slightest
&ldquo;squirmish.&rdquo; Rather have some hot soup or broth
of some kind sent up to you, and drink it sitting in your
chair. Do not be afraid to drink water at all times,
even if you feel ill&mdash;as the water is easily returned, and
it is less strain on the stomach to be able to bring up
something than to find nothing in the stomach when
an effort is made to eject what is not there. Water
will serve to allay this strain, and thus serve a useful
purpose.</p>

<p>In very severe cases of seasickness, the stomach of
the patient should be emptied and washed out at once.
This is usually an easy matter. Have the patient drink
one or two glasses of water, warm or cold, with a little
salt or bi-carbonate of soda added&mdash;say a teaspoonful
to a pint of water. This will have the desired result!
In extreme cases of seasickness, dry cold, such as
ice-bags, placed behind and about the ears, will sooth the
patient, and help to allay his suffering. Cold cloths
to the forehead will also prove helpful. Full baths had
best be omitted, until the attack has worn off, as they
are injudicious on account of the reactions they induce.</p>

<p>In prolonged cases of seasickness, there is often a
craving for acids and fruit juices. The continued
absence or diminution of the acid contents of the
stomach, and the privation from normal food, accounts
in part for this, and it is highly proper to satisfy such
a craving&mdash;providing due care is taken not to add to
the stomach's distress by taking too much juice, or the
juice of unripe fruit, or by swallowing the fibre of the
fruit, which is allowable only when recovery is
complete.</p>

<p>In response to your invitation I am sending you my experience
with vegetarian dietary. Although, as you will see, this has not
been altogether &ldquo;unfired,&rdquo; I think it should be of interest to
many.</p>

<p>(1) I became a vegetarian at the time of my marriage, nearly
three years ago, my husband being already a vegetarian of eleven
years. I considered this a good opportunity to commence.
Previous to this I had for some time suffered from indigestion,
which continued for a few months after marriage. I attribute
the cure to the change of diet, and drinking hot water after meals.</p>

<p>(2) We have one child eighteen months old, totally breast fed
for twelve months, and another four months: on breast and Ixion
Food and some fruit juice.</p>

<p>She has never had any disease whatever, and so far her teeth
are perfect and she has cut them quite easily. She is a bonny,
sturdy little girl, and very intelligent.</p>

<p>(3) With regard to childbirth, I previously followed the advice of
Dr Alice Stockholme in &ldquo;Tokology,&rdquo; avoiding flesh meats and
bone-making food and adopting a diet of fruit (chiefly lemons)
and rice, brown bread and nut butter, wearing no corsets and
taking frequent baths. The effect during pregnancy was highly
satisfactory. I enjoyed perfect health the whole time, free from
the usual discomforts, and at childbirth I received similar results:
a speedy and safe delivery. Indeed, since marriage, my husband,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg487" id="Pg487"></a>baby and myself, have been singularly free from even minor
complaints.</p>

<p>(4) As we do not have the specially prepared, expensive
vegetarian foods (supposed to substitute meat), but mainly the
simple foods, I consider the diet less costly than the meat diet.</p>

<p>(5) We are honestly quite free from the craving for meat or
meat foods.</p>

<p>(6) In the summer-time we live principally on salads, cheese,
rissoles, etc., made from beans, peas, lentils, etc., fresh fruits,
brown bread and nut butter. In the very cold weather we seem
to need rather warmer stuffs, such as porridge (carefully cooked)
and cooked vegetables, etc.</p>

<p>I have read with the greatest interest the correspondence in
<i>The Healthy Life</i> on the unfired diet. As the majority of your
correspondents have not been living <i>exclusively</i> on unfired food, or
have only done so for short periods, may I suggest that some of
your correspondents or contributors live on an <i>entirely</i> unfired
diet, <i>excluding dairy produce</i>, for a period of six or twelve months
and then relate their experiences. In this way some valuable
evidence would be obtained. At any rate I am prepared to do this
myself.</p>

<p>With reference to living on the unfired diet on 4d. a day, I
have often had two unfired meals for less than 4d., and two meals
a day are sufficient for anyone. Of course to do this one has to
buy the food which is in season and therefore cheap. Dried fruit
and nuts, followed by a cress salad with oil and lemon dressing,
does not cost more than 2d. An unfired rissole made from grated
carrot and flaked peanuts cost at most a penny, and if followed
by dates or figs would be a sufficient meal, and 2d. would cover
the cost.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have no difficulty in producing a &ldquo;two course&rdquo;
unfired meal for 2d.&mdash;but perhaps I should have left the subject
of cost for Dr Bell to deal with. Yours faithfully,</p>

<h2><a name="MORE_ABOUT_TWO_MEALS_A_DAY" id="MORE_ABOUT_TWO_MEALS_A_DAY"></a>MORE ABOUT TWO MEALS A DAY.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">W</span>ith reference to my article, &ldquo;Two Meals a
Day,&rdquo; which appeared in the May issue of
<i>The Healthy Life</i>, several correspondents have
asked me to give more particulars about my life and
diet. I do so gladly; but I must be brief, as the
demand upon space in this magazine is now very great.</p>

<p>Resolved into a single sentence, what all my correspondents
wish to know is this: Is a two-meal dietary
best for all?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg488" id="Pg488"></a>To this question, however, a definite answer cannot
be given, for the simple reason that scientific experimentation
with respect to food quantities and times of
meals, etc., has gone such a little way, so that it
would be <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'presumptious'.">presumptuous</ins> to set a limit in regard to meals
and food reduction. To my mind, apart from the
question of the quantity of food to be taken, there is
a great and important field of inquiry open with respect
to the effect of rest upon the stomach and the intestines,
upon the digestive and assimilative powers of the body.</p>

<p>Now the whole purpose of my article was to show that
a reduction of one's dietary was a matter of training,
of gradual adaptation, but also&mdash;and this is the important
fact-of gradual strengthening. My theory is
that the two-meal plan is possible owing to the immense
economy in digestive energy that is effected through
giving the stomach adequate rest, and also through
keeping the blood stream pure and unclogged, almost
absolutely free from surfeit matter. A rested stomach
will get more nutriment out of a small amount of food-stuff
than an overworked stomach will get out of a
much larger quantity. But experimentation which is
sudden and covers a few weeks only, is worse than
useless, as it tends to disprove the very principles that
a saner method of experimentation would probably
establish. And if I can impress this fact upon the reader
I shall have performed a good service.</p>

<p>Carefully undertaken, and properly graduated, I
believe there are few people in these days who would not
greatly benefit by a reduction in the number of meals
and in the quantity of food they take. By means of a
healthy and cheerful habit of introspection&mdash;not morbid
and feverish&mdash;I am firmly convinced that by cutting
down their meals most people would not only greatly
improve their health, but their mental and spiritual
condition as well, and also greatly increase their capacity
for work ... And if in this way we can effect such an
improvement in our life and condition it does not really
matter whether we get to the two or even one meal
basis or not.</p>

<p>As to myself, my work is chiefly literary and my life
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg489" id="Pg489"></a>moderately sedentary. But the fact is that I now have
two moderate meals a day whereas I used to have four
pretty good ones. But I have many friends whose work
is mechanical, and demands much muscular energy, who
are two-mealists. One lady I know, who is one of the
healthiest, strongest and best physically developed
persons I have ever met, is a two-mealist, and not only
does she work at a mechanical occupation for ten hours
a day, but on several evenings each week conducts a
ladies gymnastics class as well. But in her case, as in
mine, the two meal was an ideal that was gradually
and slowly attained, and not a sudden reform. Indeed,
the main thing to remember is that it is all a matter of
training, it being quite impossible to say where the
limit is. For of one thing I am quite sure&mdash;viz. that
most people, were they to adopt a slow process of food
and meals reduction, on the lines I suggested in my
article, would be astonished at the result. The number
of people one meets, chiefly among those whose life
is more or less sedentary, who say they can't work as
they should, are subject to pains and heaviness in the
head, constipation and indigestion, is simply appalling;
and on questioning such people I come to the conclusion
that in the majority of cases it is because they eat too
much or too often.</p>

<p>My meals are very simple, and the simpler they are
the better I like them. I like a cold lunch about noon,
and a hot meal about six. I have tried a wholly uncooked
diet, but as yet my body does not seem ready
for it: perhaps it will be after a little while. The first
meal usually consists of wholemeal bread and fruit,
green or vegetable salads, just according to my needs
at the time. In winter I take a more liberal supply of
dried fruits and nuts. Pulses I eschew altogether.
My second meal consists of a substantial entr&eacute;e with
one or two conservatively cooked vegetables&mdash;occasionally
I have a soup and a sweet in addition. But of
course it is for everyone to find out his or her own ideal
diet; and let me say that it is worth while to do so, even
though it involves much confusion and perplexity during
the period of experimentation.</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">O</span>nce upon a time there was a little boy whose
parents took things very seriously. They
answered all his questions with painstaking
precision. At a comparatively early age he could prove
that fairies were non-existent. At the same time his
toys were marvels of mechanical perfection.</p>

<p>At the age of seven he was sent to a very efficient
school, where, being naturally a bright boy, he gained
high marks every term and passed all the examinations,
for he had a wonderful and well-trained faculty for
remembering exactly what his teachers had told him.</p>

<p>When he left school he entered a London merchant's
office, where his knowledge of arithmetic was of the
greatest assistance in bringing him to the front. Moreover,
he could argue very tellingly with all the clerks
and warehousemen, and always knew what the morning
papers were saving about health, neck-ties or religion.</p>

<p>In course of time he grew a moustache, joined the
Territorials, was made a partner in the firm, married
a well-educated young lady and became a strong
supporter of the local Liberal Club, where his
opinions were so well known that it was unnecessary for
anyone seriously to combat them. He was never known
to vote for the Conservative candidate or to lose his
head. His concluding speech in the historic debate on
The National Health Insurance Act will always be
remembered, by those who heard it, for its earnest
defence of the medical profession. In fact, the Mayor,
who was in the chair, and was a doctor himself, warmly
congratulated the speaker, who was evidently very
pleased.</p>

<p>Ten years later he became a Town Councillor, opened
several Institutes for the Care of the Poor, and sent
his second son to join the eldest at the same kind of
school at which he (the father) had been so well trained.
About the same date he bought a new edition of the
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica and carefully compiled a list
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg492" id="Pg492"></a>of facts and figures showing that idealists and all
new-fangled ideas were the greatest danger to the increasing
trade and expansion of the Empire.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty he took a house at Surbiton and
was continually congratulated on his hale and hearty
appearance. His opinions were known and respected
by all who met him. His sons were models of what
the children of such a father should be, and they
supported him in every argument.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty-two he retired from business. A
month later he had an idea; and it so interfered with all
his opinions, and so affected his general health, that he
died.</p>

<p>He stopped smoking tobacco on the second day, and does not
mean to resume its use. Of course he had no alcohol in any form during
the fast, but he never has taken much alcohol, although he was
not a pledged abstainer. The temperature was taken many times and
seems to have been almost always subnormal, about 97 degrees
Fahr., but this is not so unusual a condition as to call for
comment. The chief cause of a subnormal temperature, in my
opinion, is blocking of the body with too much food. No doubt
in prolonged fasting the temperature may fall also; but sometimes
a fast will be the cause of raising a subnormal bodily
temperature, as happened in a case of mine in which on the
twenty-eighth day of the fast there was a large elimination of
urates by the kidneys and a rise of temperature from 96 degrees
to 98.4 degrees. Subnormal bodily temperature has not received
the attention which it deserves. It is usually one of the
forerunners, or prodromata as they are called, of the onset of incurable
diseases like cancer, Bright's disease or apoplexy. The commonly
accepted view that the heat of the body depends upon the food,
and that people eat blubber in the Arctic and Antarctic regions to
keep the bodily heat up, is one of the chief causes for neglect
of the study of subnormal temperature. And it is quite surprising
that physiologists have not thought it necessary to explain why
nature has provided sugar and palm oil and cocoa-nut oil and
ground-nut oil in the tropical regions, as well as abundance of
olive oil in the warm temperate regions of the earth if these foods
keep the bodily heat up. They ought to have been more
abundantly supplied in the Arctic and Antarctic regions if the
accepted view is correct. Besides, if we must eat blubber to
keep bodily heat up in the Arctic regions when the outside
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg493" id="Pg493"></a>temperature is 50 or 100 or more degrees lower than that of the
body, what ought we to eat in the tropics to keep bodily heat
down when the outside temperature is 50 or even 80 degrees
above that of the body? Physiologists have not explained this,
although assuredly an explanation is wanted. But the true
explanation, the correct explanation, would have demolished the
doctrine that bodily heat is due to the food, and so it has not
been given. It is too simple to imagine that the bodily heat is,
like the body itself and all its functions, the effect of the
life-force that inhabits the body and builds up the body so that the
body shall be a fit dwelling-place for itself&mdash;this explanation is too
simple and too idealistic for modern science, which is less and less
disposed, we are told, to invoke the aid of a force of life to account
for vital phenomena, although it assumes an attracting force to
account for gravitating phenomena, and an electric and chemic
force to account for electric and chemic phenomena. Modern
science (and ancient science, too, apparently) which sees well
enough that an idealistic or a materialistic explanation would
equally account for the nexus of the phenomena of the universe,
deliberately and almost invariably prefers the materialistic
explanation. She is anxious that we should be kept free of
superstition. But the superstition that forces are the effects of things
does not seem to distress her at all. And so we are told that
gravitation is a property of matter, and are forbidden to think
that perhaps gravitation, a force, procreates matter, a thing, in order
that the effects of the fore may be perceived by dull sense. We
are told that the function of the liver and the brain depends on
the structure of the liver and the brain respectively and we are
not allowed to think that perhaps the force of animal life,
feeling the need of an instrument to secrete bile, on the one hand,
and to secrete cerebral lymph to act as a vehicle for the conveyance
of thought and emotion and higher things, on the other,
introduces the liver with its elaborate structure and the brain with
its still more complicated structure, in order that both the one
function and the other may be well performed. And so, although
all forms of kinetic energy (and among them zoo-dynamic, or the
force of animal life) manifest warmth and luminosity as qualities,
science attributes animal heat to chemic force and refuses to
consider that perhaps zoo-dynamic uses chemico-dynamic for its
own purposes, even if these purposes are unconscious, because
the higher force always dominates the lower. Properly speaking,
science is out of her sphere, though she does not seem to know
it, in making these suggestions. When she keeps herself to the
investigation of facts, their exposition, their sequence and their
laws, in her painstaking and accurate manner, we accept her
revelations thankfully, and beg her to allow us to make our own
philosophic and other explanations in attempting to account for
the existence, sequences and relations of the facts of life.</p>

<p>After his return home, patient continued to gain weight, as
might have been expected. On the seventeenth day after ending
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg494" id="Pg494"></a>the fast he weighed 140 lbs. and on the nineteenth day 144 lbs.
On that day he received from a hospital a report that the reaction
of the physiologico-pathological test was negative. This has
naturally had a great effect on the patient; and it is worthy of
very careful consideration. Of course one negative result may not
be conclusive although it was positive before the fast. But if the
result should be repeated, and especially if it should prove
to be permanent, the importance of the fact can hardly be
exaggerated, since the suggestion arises in our minds that perhaps
we may be able to cure profound blood-poisoning by fasting,
neither the usual treatment nor the use of Salvarsan enabling the
investigator to say that the result of the pathological reaction
was negative; but this has followed after a heroic fast of 56 days.
The result if confirmed would not be unique. Quite recently I
saw a specific ulcer close to the ankle-joint for which operation
had been recommended. It seemed to me that operation would be
likely to open the joint, and that therefore it was a risky
proceeding. But under a restriction of the diet, putting the young
man on barley-water for a few days and then advising him to
eat once a day only, the ulcer became very much smaller, and no
operation has had to be performed. Blood-poisoning of this
nature, of course, is not caused by improper nutrition, but it may
readily be believed to be aggravated by the ordinary conventional
over-feeding to which, so far as I can see, we are all subjecting
ourselves, especially as persons who put themselves in the way of
contracting blood-poisoning do not generally belong to the class of
those who are attracted by the suggestion that it is noble to keep the
body under, and that if we do not strive to keep the body under, it will
be very likely to keep us under. Although we shall be liable to be
infected, however we live, still we may believe that we shall be
more likely to be badly infected (if we put ourselves in the way
of contracting disease) if we have been previously subjected to the
bad effects of over-feeding. This consideration renders a possible
cure by fasting, a not impossible suggestion. And if, therefore, we
have in fasting the suggestion of a remedy which offers us the
hope of eradicating such a fearful disease from the human system,
it certainly behoves us to make use of it.</p>

<p>As a rule it seems to me that bad forms of blood-poisoning
of this nature are incurable. In three or four
generations they destroy the strain affected by it, do
what we will. Meantime it shows all the signs and
symptoms of a hereditary disease, for the children are born
suffering, showing a coppery rash, and old before they are young.
And when they get a little older they have no bridges to their
noses, their teeth are ill-formed, their vision is imperfect, their
intellects dull. It seems as if nature could not forgive crimes of
this nature. She seems to treat them as the unpardonable sin.
If we find cancer appearing in a family at 55 years of age in 3 or
4 successive generations, there is no proof of heredity in that.
Inquire and see if like causes acting on like organisms in 3 or 4
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg495" id="Pg495"></a>successive generations have not produced the disease each time. The
children are not born cancerous, and our efforts to prevent the
disease may succeed. But children often <i>are</i> born with specific
disease, and there is no doubt at all about its being a hereditary
disease. Even now I should not like to sanction marriage in the
case of this man who has heroically fasted for 56 days, although
he seems for the present to have got rid of his disease. But the
outlook is hopeful, more hopeful than I thought, and in the hope
that the suggestion may convey a message of hope to those who
are willing to do penance for crimes against the body, I send out
these remarks. The opinion expressed by the patient that he was
getting rid of the Salvarsan which had been injected into his
blood to cure his disease is, of course, his own only. I offer no
opinion upon it. But I think the whole case very instructive, and
it will be deeply interesting to follow it up with special regard to
the inquiry whether the pathological test remains negative. The
reflective reader of these remarks will need no hint from me to
suggest how a study of questions of this sort raises in our minds
all sorts of other questions, physical, metaphysical, philosophical,
social, religious; what are laws of nature, how they come to be
what they are, whether they can be disregarded without paying the
penalty, and whether we men are bond or free. Each of us will
settle these questions for ourselves, for each of us is responsible
for his own conclusion. But as to the inevitableness with which
such questions do rise in our minds, I take it there can be no
difference of opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="HEALTHY_HOMEMAKING1" id="HEALTHY_HOMEMAKING1"></a>HEALTHY HOMEMAKING.</h2>


<p><i>For the benefit of new readers it seems well to explain
that this series of articles is not intended for the
instruction of experienced housewives. It was started
at the special request of a reader who asked for &ldquo;a
little book on housekeeping, for those of us who know
nothing at all about it; and put in all the little details
that are presumably regarded as too trivial or too
obvious to be mentioned in the ordinary books on
domestic economy.&rdquo;</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">XXI. Hired Help.</span></h3>

<p><span class="firstletter">I</span>t does not seem proper to conclude the present
series of articles without touching upon the
&ldquo;servant problem,&rdquo; but I do not pretend to be able
to solve it. It is a problem usually very difficult of
solution by the homemaker of small means. If she has
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg496" id="Pg496"></a>but few persons to cater for, and is not the mother of
a young family, she is often very much better off
without hired help, except for a periodical charwoman.
But it is not always indispensable to the woman who
has other duties besides housekeeping.</p>

<p>I am not here concerned with the housewife who can
afford to keep more than one efficient servant. Indeed,
I am hardly concerned with one who can employ a
really good &ldquo;general&rdquo; at from &pound;20 to &pound;25 per annum.
The person I am concerned with is the homemaker who
can afford at most to employ an inexperienced young
girl at from &pound;10 to &pound;14 per annum.</p>

<p>I will draw the worst side of the picture first, for
although it <i>is</i> the worst side it is true enough, as so
many harassed housewives know.</p>

<p>The young &ldquo;general&rdquo; often comes straight from a
council school where domestic economy had no place
in the curriculum, and from a home in name only.
Such an one is usually slatternly and careless in all her
ways, has no idea of personal cleanliness, and regards
her &ldquo;mistress&rdquo; as, more or less, her natural enemy!
She is &ldquo;in service&rdquo; only under compulsion, and envies
those of her schoolmates whose more fortunate
circumstances have enabled them to become &ldquo;young lady&rdquo;
shop assistants, typists and even elementary school
teachers. If she had her choice she would prefer labour
in a factory to domestic work; but either a factory is
not available, or the girl's parents consider &ldquo;service&rdquo;
more &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; in spite of its hardships. Its
hardships? Yes, it <i>is</i> its hardships that account for its
peculiar unpopularity. For there are hardships connected
with domestic service in small households that
do not apply to other forms of much harder labour.</p>

<p>Everyone who is familiar with the small lower
middle-class household knows how often the life of the
little &ldquo;general&rdquo; resembles that of an animal rather
than a human being. All day long she drudges in a
muddling, inefficient way, continually scolded for her
inefficiency yet never really taught how to do anything
properly. Her work is never done, for she is always
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg497" id="Pg497"></a>at the beck and call of her employers; yet she lives apart
in social isolation, is referred to contemptuously as the
&ldquo;slavey,&rdquo; and even her food is dispensed to her grudgingly
and minus the special dainties bought for Sundays
and holidays. This is domestic service at its worst, of
course, but the prevalence of such &ldquo;places&rdquo; in actual fact
is undoubtedly at the root of the young girl's objection to
it. How can she help gleaning the impression that such
work is &ldquo;menial,&rdquo; when her employers more or less
openly despise her? Being human, how can she but
envy those of her old friends who have their evenings
to themselves? What contentment can she find in a
life of drudgery unenlightened by intelligent interest
in learning how to do something well? What wonder
that all her hopes and ambitions become centred in the
possession of a &ldquo;young man,&rdquo; and that reason&mdash;stunted
from its birth for lack of room to grow&mdash;being
entirely absent from her choice, she marries badly and
too young, and becomes the mother of a numerous
progeny as helpless, hopeless, stunted and inefficient
as herself?</p>

<p>Some conscientious women try to remedy this state of
things by treating the girls they take into their homes
as &ldquo;one of the family.&rdquo; This <i>may</i> answer well sometimes,
but it has its drawbacks, both for the girl and
the &ldquo;family.&rdquo; Husband and wife, brother and sister,
inevitably find the constant presence of a stranger with
whom they have little in common very irksome. While
the girl herself is equally conscious of restraint when
forced to spend her leisure time with her employers.
She would usually infinitely prefer the solitude of the
kitchen, if combined with a good fire, a comfortable
chair and a story book.</p>

<p>Among the girls I have spoken to on the subject I
have not found &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; households popular. One
girl I met refused to stay in such a place for longer
than three days, because she &ldquo;never had the kitchen
to herself.&rdquo; Another told me that she found it intensely
boring to take meals with the family, because she was
not interested in the things they talked about.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg498" id="Pg498"></a>I think that the ultimate solution of the &ldquo;servant
problem&rdquo; will not be that every woman will do all her
own housework, but that domestic work will become,
on the one hand, very much simplified and, on the other,
will be put on the same footing as teaching, nursing
or secretarial work. That we are beginning to move in
this direction is evidenced by the coming into existence
of schools of domestic economy, to which &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; do
not disdain to resort for training. This will undoubtedly
result in domestic labour becoming a much higher-priced
commodity than it is now, the housewife will have
to pay at least as much for three hours help per day as
she now does for nine hours, but the fact that the help
will be skilled, combined with the greater simplicity of
housework, will surely more than compensate for this.</p>

<p>But what is the homemaker of limited means, who
must have some help, to do under present conditions?
This we must consider next month.</p>

<blockquote><p>Miss L.C. writes:&mdash;I should be deeply indebted to you if you
would advise me in the following matter. I have been suffering
from a recurrence of boils on different parts of my body during
the last six months. I have consulted a local doctor, but he can
find no reason for their appearance, but suggested I should try a
mixed diet, to include some animal food, rather than adhere to
vegetarianism as I have done for some two years past.</p>

<p>My diet is about as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Tumblerful of hot water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast</i> (eight o'clock).&mdash;One egg, toasted bread (wholemeal)
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg499" id="Pg499"></a>and butter, with either a little lettuce or marmalade and either
weak tea or cocoa.</p>

<p><i>Lunch</i> (one o'clock).&mdash;Steamed green or root vegetable, with
cheese sauce or macaroni cheese or similar savoury, or nuts.
Boiled or baked pudding or stewed fruit with custard or blanc
mange.</p>

<p><i>Tea</i> (four o'clock).&mdash;Tea or cocoa, with or without a little
bread and butter and cake.</p>

<p><i>Supper</i> (7 o'clock).&mdash;Vegetable soup, milk pudding and a little
cheese, butter and salad and wholemeal bread.</p>

<p>I am forty-nine years of age, lead a fairly active life, frequently
taking walking exercise. I am very tall and weigh twelve stone.
Have had no serious illness, but been more or less an&aelig;mic all my
life.</p>

<p>If you can tell me whether there is anything wrong in connection
with my diet and suggest the cause of, and treatment for, the
boils I shall be exceedingly obliged.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to help this correspondent to permanently
get rid of these boils, we must first ascertain what those
troublesome manifestations are and look to the causes
which produce them.</p>

<p>A boil is a small, tense, painful, inflammatory swelling
appearing in or upon the skin, and is due to the local
death or gangrene of a small portion of the skin's
surface. This eventually comes away in the form of
a core, and, until this has cleared away, the boil will
not heal or cease to be painful.</p>

<p>Boils occur chiefly on the neck, arms or buttocks. If
very large they are known as carbuncles, and if they
occur on the fingers or toes they are described as whitlows.
It is often the friction of a frayed-out collar or
cuff, of tight waist clothing, or, in the case of whitlows,
the introduction of some irritant or poison between the
nail and the skin that determines the precise site at
which they will come.</p>

<p>Boils, although rarely dangerous to life, are usually
accompanied by pain severe out of all proportion to
the extent of surface involved. This gives rise to much
broken rest and loss of vitality, which at once ceases
when the boil has finished its course. Boils usually
occur in series or crops.</p>

<p>Now large numbers of people wear collars and cuffs
with frayed edges, or handle irritants with their fingers,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg500" id="Pg500"></a>but they do not necessarily contract boils or whitlows.
Therefore, we see that there must be other factors to
be taken into consideration to account for their presence.
The orthodox germ-loving practitioner may tell
you that a boil is a purely local disorder and that a
certain form of microbe, known as the <i>Staphylococcus
pyogenes</i>, is the cause of it. This germ, he asserts, lives
normally on the surface of the skin and, when this
surface becomes broken, it enters the part and infects
it, thereby starting the boil.</p>

<p>If this is true every person who wears old collars or
dabbles his hands in dirt should without exception contract
boils. This is obviously untrue.</p>

<p>The factor to be considered, then, is this. What is it
that induces boils in one person and not in another
under identical circumstances? The answer is obvious.
The boil is not a local disease at all, but is a manifestation
of some constitutional defect, or of some
impurity of the blood stream, which enables this microbe
to find a congenial breeding ground.</p>

<p>The people who suffer most from boils are young
or middle-aged adults, and we usually find the two
extremes among sufferers. There is the full-blooded,
often overfed, individual and there is the pale, debilitated
and emaciated person whose constitution is broken
down by worry, overwork, sexual troubles, unhealthy
surroundings or badly selected foods.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the constitutional history of these
cases we shall almost invariably discover that the
digestive or assimilative processes of the body are not
working smoothly. This may be due to the worry or
overwork, or to unhealthy surroundings which dis-harmonise
the digestive and nutritive functions, or to
nervous exhaustion from one cause or another, or it
may be due to the wrong diet, which is filling the
colon (or large bowel) with fermenting poisons.</p>

<p>When the body is clogged in this manner nature
often proceeds to get rid of the accumulating waste
through the skin. By a vigorous effort on the part of
the life-force the impurity is thrown outwards to the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg501" id="Pg501"></a>surface. Looked at in this light a boil is really a most
salutary cleansing agent, and the Nature-Cure practitioner,
who calls it a &ldquo;Crisis,&rdquo; often does everything
in his power to produce boils when treating chronic
diseases.</p>

<p>The alternative is often some more deeply seated
form of elimination, resulting in serious organic disease
of the organs or tissues. One of the first signs of
improvement in disorders like diabetes, consumption,
arthritis, Bright's disease, or even cancer, is the appearance
of boils, showing that the vitality has improved
to an extent sufficient to enable the foreign matter to
be expelled by means of relatively harmless boils. The
hydropathic expert also tries to induce this condition
by means of his mustard and water packs.</p>

<p>If our correspondent wants to rid herself of her boils
she must adopt all means to improve her vitality and to
cleanse her body of its impurities. She can do this along
many lines. She can take a holiday and rest from her
work; or by positive thinking she can set to work to get
rid of her worries. She can learn to laugh as often as
possible, and to breathe deeply, slowly and fully. If
her house is unsanitary she should make it sanitary,
or move elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then she must restrict her diet and take only those
forms of food which create a minimum amount of
poison in the system. <i>She must cleanse the colon daily</i>
with warm water enemas, and encourage the action of
the kidneys in doing their rightful part in the elimination
of poisons by the drinking of distilled water or a good
herbal tea on rising, and of clear vegetable broth at
night.</p>

<p>Clay packs, applied cold, are the best form of treatment
for application to the boils themselves. They
should never be cut or squeezed, as this only intensifies
the trouble. Hot applications, as poultices, are bad,
because they induce the boil to mature prematurely, and
also are conducive to reinfection of the skin in other
parts. Drugs or medicines are of very little use in the
treatment of boils, because they do not go to the root
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg502" id="Pg502"></a>of the trouble. The only remedy that I have found of
any avail is yeast. In former times this was taken
in the form of fresh or dried brewers' yeast, and it was,
if unpleasant, a very effectual remedy. Yeast yields
a free supply of what is called nuclein and nucleinic
acid. These, chemically, are identical with the same
substances found in the human cells. Nuclein is a
powerful antiseptic. It has been found that the toxins
or emanations from diphtheria and other deadly germs
are precipitated and destroyed by nucleinic acid.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that yeast extracts, such as
Marmite, often have a beneficial effect in disorders
accompanied by the formation of pus matter.</p>

<p>Our correspondent's diet should be amended as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;A cupful of unseasoned Marmite.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;One scrambled or lightly poached egg
with stale, yeast-made, wholemeal bread and nut butter,
with lettuce or other salad food. No marmalade; no tea
or coffee.</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;1 to 2 oz. of grated cheese or flaked pine
kernels, finely shredded raw cabbage, or grated
radishes, or grated raw roots with oil and lemon dressing.
No cooked savouries, no puddings, nor stewed
fruit with custard or blanc mange should be taken.</p>

<p><i>Tea Meal.</i>&mdash;Cupful of Marmite, only.</p>

<p><i>Supper.</i>&mdash;Clear, unseasoned, vegetable broth, with
Veda or wholemeal bread, or Granose biscuits, with
nut butter and some fresh fruit.</p>

<p><i>At bedtime.</i>&mdash;A cupful of Marmite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The unseasoned Marmite should be used, as the ordinary
kind is rather heavily salted.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs H.W. writes:&mdash;I should be very glad if you would give me
enlightenment on one or two points about my diet. I am suffering
from a somewhat dilated stomach, also a catarrhal condition of
nose, throat and alimentary canal, with constipation and much
flatulence in the bowels. My teeth are decaying quickly, my nails
have got softer, and I have become an&aelig;mic and generally
debilitated, being unable to properly assimilate my food. All my
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg503" id="Pg503"></a>joints crack when moved, and the knee joints creak as well. Is
this a uric acid condition, or do you think it merely due to a
lack of nourishment, causing a lack of synovial fluid? The joints
are not swollen and not painful, they merely crack. My whole
system seems to be over-acid, and my mouth gets sore and
ulcerated. I have got very thin, having lost a stone in twelve
months.</p>

<p>I notice that you always advise for dilated stomach greatly
restricting the liquid part of the diet. Will you tell me just
how much one <i>may</i> drink in a day, because when I go without
drinking my constipation and other troubles are worse and the
urine gets thick and muddy.</p>

<p>You also deprecate milk. This puzzled me until you explained
to a correspondent last month in <i>The Healthy Life</i>. Will you
tell me if the same applies to dried milk&mdash;will it tend to increase
intestinal trouble? I am anxious to know this because I have
been relying somewhat on Emprote and Hygiama lately, for I had
got so that I could scarcely digest anything.</p>

<p>Do you consider it better to use the enema than to take a mild
aperient? I do not want to start with the enema again if I can
possibly manage to do without, because I found that my bowels
depended upon it. And that is why I want to ask if it is absolutely
necessary when on an antiseptic diet to entirely avoid fruit. I
find it so necessary to keep the bowels working naturally.</p>

<p>I <i>do</i> want you to answer me these questions, because I have got
so worried and fearful (people's theories are so varied) that I
scarcely dare eat any food at all. I am at present taking only
two meals daily (I like the two-meal plan best): at eleven <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I take a cup of weak coffee on rising, without milk or
sugar&mdash;this warm drink seems to start the peristaltic action and
I then get bowel action. I think of changing the coffee for
Sanum Tonic Tea or Dandelion Coffee.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock I have an egg with Winter's &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo;
bread and almond butter, and some conservatively cooked
vegetable (celery or carrot or spinach).</p>

<p>At six <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I have one or two baked apples, a teaspoonful or
two of malted nuts, or Emprote, and more &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo; bread
and butter.</p>

<p>At four <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I take a cup of barley water or carrot water, and
at bedtime another cup of barley water.</p>

<p>Do you think that if I went on to a milk diet for a time it
would do good?</p></blockquote>

<p>This correspondent seems to be suffering from auto-tox&aelig;mia,
or self-poisoning in a severe form, and a
condition of what is termed arterio-sclerosis or
premature old age. Associated with it are evidently
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, which is affecting
her joints and teeth. It is not one of ordinary gout or
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg504" id="Pg504"></a>uric acid poisoning. The trouble no doubt has been
caused by past errors of diet, so that the present efforts
at reform have come too late to be of service to her.
Something more than diet is now needed to clear the
acids and toxins from the system. It is not a simple
case of digestive catarrh, for the whole body is affected.
The present diet will answer very well as it stands.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to obtain a well-fitting dilatation
belt. This must have leg straps and firmly support the
lower half of the abdomen. The next thing is to promote
skin action so <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'are'.">as</ins> to encourage the clearing out of
poisons along this line of elimination. Vapour baths,
wet-sheet packs or alkaline hot baths can effect this
purpose. An alkaline hot bath should be of a temperature
of 105 degrees Fahr. or more, and to the bath
should be added &frac14; lb. of bicarbonate of soda and &frac14; lb.
packet of &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; starch. She should remain as long
as possible in this so as to well clear the acids from the
skin and induce as much skin action or perspiration as
possible. The <i>first</i> baths must be of very short duration,
and she should be careful to avoid chill after the bath;
it is best to lie prone and completely relaxed for half-an-hour
at least after the bath. Finally massage and
Swedish movements directed to the entire back will

<p class="corresp">You will see that your little magazine finds its way even to
this out-of-the-way corner of the globe, and you may be sure that it
is appreciated. I am specially interested in Dr V. Knaggs' contributions
and should like to ask him a few questions. May I
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg505" id="Pg505"></a>say that I have some knowledge of chemistry and that I try and
take an interest in the scientific aspects of food reform.</p>

<p>(1) P. 237. What grounds has Dr Knaggs for speaking so
definitely about human magnetism and that of vegetables? How
would he recognise or test for either, and where can I get further
information (scientific) on the question of food magnetism.</p>

<p>(2) Same page. Dr Knaggs says salt added to cooking
vegetables converts organic salts into inorganic. I cannot follow
that. <i>What</i> organic salts are so converted? One or two examples
would suffice.</p>

<p>(3) I have been reading Dr Rabagliati's <i>Conversations with
Women Concerning their Health and that of their Children</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
it he says that food is not the source (cause) of body energy, but
is used merely to replace waste material. Elsewhere I read that
&ldquo;Professor Atwater's investigations into nutrition have shown in
a most convincing manner that the body derives <i>all</i> its energy
from the food consumed. This may be regarded as established.&rdquo;
Which of these definite and contradictory assertions does Dr
Knaggs support, and why? Where can I get information <i>re</i>
Professor Atwater's experiments and other recent works on similar
subjects?</p>

<p>To me the questions involved are intensely interesting, hence
my queries. I hope they do not read as if I were hypercritical
or sceptical.</p>

<p>We handed the above interesting letter to our contributor,
Dr H. Valentine Knaggs, and append his
reply:&mdash;</p>


<h3><a name="Magnetism" id="Magnetism"></a><span class="smcap">Human Magnetism.</span></h3>

<p>There is very little information available from ordinary
scientific sources anent the question of the life-force or of
the animal magnetism which animates our bodies and
is the motive force common to all organic structures
whether animal or vegetable. We do know that fresh
fruits and vegetables are strongly magnetic because the
magnetism which they emit can be gauged by means of
delicate galvanometers. It has been found that leaves,
flowers and seeds are positively, and roots negatively,
charged. We also know that the same conditions are
found in the human subject, since Dr Baraduc, who is
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg506" id="Pg506"></a>a celebrated French Psycho-Therapeutist, in his book,
&ldquo;The Vibrations of Human Vitality,&rdquo; tells us that he
has invented a machine called a biometer to test these
very vibrations. I have had one of these machines
myself and have experimented with it a great deal. By
its aid we can make the machine work differently with
different persons, and by careful tabulation of records
Dr Baraduc has been able to elicit some very remarkable
information about the magnetic currents which are
constantly flowing into and out of the human body. If
our correspondent really wants to know more about
the wonders of human magnetism he should read some
of the voluminous literature upon the subject published
by the Theosophical Society. Just recently also a Dr
Kilner has invented a form of coloured screen by which
he and others who have some psychic sight can actually
see the magnetic emanations which flow through a
person placed in a darkened room.</p>


<h3><a name="SaltCooked" id="SaltCooked"></a><span class="smcap">Salt-cooked Vegetables.</span></h3>

<p>The one object of the vegetable kingdom is to build
up, for the use of the animal or organic realm, the
constituents found in the mineral or inorganic kingdom.
These mineral constituents are dissolved, sorted out
and built up in the right proportions for the use of
animals when taken as foods. Whenever these foods
are not so eaten they are sent back again to the earth
by the aid of microbes during the process of decay, to
be again available for plant use. Cooking is a process
invented by man which is <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'analagous'.">analogous</ins> to that of decay,
for it dissolves and disintegrates the structures which
Nature has built up. When man eats food that is
partially disintegrated he does not obtain from it the
right sort of nutriment which Nature intended him to
have. To intensify the wrong-doings of the cook, man
further hastens the disintegrating process by adding to
the things that he cooks a due proportion of a common
and very stable mineral, called salt. It is powerful,
because it is not easily disintegrated. The salt greatly
expedites the process of decay, whether in the natural
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg507" id="Pg507"></a>form of fermentation, or whether by the application of
heat, as in cooking. Salt is used in Nature to promote
the flow of those electric and magnetic currents which
are a manifestation of the universal life-force which
pervades all things seen and unseen. It is an essential
constituent of the sea because the ocean is the life-blood
of the earth. It is an essential constituent of our
own blood, because it is needed to make the blood
stream a good conductor of magnetic currents. When
you put this salt into water and then proceed to boil
vegetables in it, it quickly sucks out all the life-force
from them, and if persisted in reduces them to the
state of minerals from which they were originally constructed.</p>


<h3><a name="Energy" id="Energy"></a><span class="smcap">Food and the Source of Bodily Energy.</span></h3>

<p>Dr Rabagliati and Professor Atwater are, I believe,
both right, but the former does not always explain
himself clearly to the lay mind. The life-force or animal
magnetism is the real source of bodily energy, and it
manifests itself only when it has something that resists
or regulates its flow.</p>

<p>It does this just as certain forms of wire, or other
materials, which possess indifferent conducting power,
resist the flow of electricity through them.</p>

<p>Electricity cannot manifest as light in the usual
electric lights used in our houses, as heat in the
electric culinary appliances or stoves, or even as power
in the motors which run our trams and trains, unless it
be given the requisite apparatus to bring about the
manifestation required.</p>

<p>In exactly the same way life cannot manifest itself
as consciousness, with its flow of thoughts, emotions
and bodily activities, without the food which is daily
supplied to the body.</p>

<p>It consequently depends considerably upon how we
select our daily rations as to how this vital force will
manifest within us.</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">F</span>ood reformers sometimes forget that &ldquo;man
does not live by bread alone,&rdquo; not even when
supplemented by an ample supply of fresh
air and physical exercise.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by psychologists that the
more highly organised and highly developed the
creature, the less it depends on nervous energy
obtained via the stomach and the more it depends
on energy generated by the brain. True, the brain
must be healthy for this, and one poisoned by
impure blood, due to wrong feeding, cannot be
healthy. But something more than clean blood is
necessary. For, as change of physical posture is
necessary to avoid cramped limbs, so periodic
reversal of mental attitude (consideration from other
than the one view-point) is necessary to the brain's
health.</p>

<p>Again, change of air is often prescribed when the
patient's real need is a change of the personalities
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg510" id="Pg510"></a>surrounding him. While for the lonely country
dweller a bath in the magnetism of a city crowd
may be a far more efficacious remedy than the
medicinal baths prescribed by his physician.</p>

<h2><a name="FEAR_AND_IMAGINATION" id="FEAR_AND_IMAGINATION"></a>FEAR AND IMAGINATION.</h2>


<p><i>Regular readers will recognise in this article a continuation of
the series previously entitled &ldquo;Healthy Brains.&rdquo; The author of
&ldquo;The Children All Day Long,&rdquo; is an intimate disciple of one of
the greatest living psychologists, and she has a message of the
first importance to all who realise that true health depends as
much on poise of mind as on physical fitness. We regret that in
the previous article, &ldquo;Imagination in Play,&rdquo; the following misprints
occurred:&mdash;P. 475, line 4 from top, &ldquo;movement&rdquo; should be
&ldquo;moment&rdquo;; p. 475, line 5 from bottom, &ldquo;admiration&rdquo; should be
&ldquo;imagination.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">S</span>ome people are given to excusing their own
uncharitable thoughts by saying, &ldquo;I suppose I
ought not to have minded her rudeness; I am
afraid I am too sensitive.&rdquo; In the same way, people
say, &ldquo;Oh, I <i>couldn't</i> sleep in the house alone&rdquo; (or let
a child go on a water-picnic, or nurse a case of delirium
or do some other thing that suggested itself), &ldquo;I have
too much imagination.&rdquo; In both cases the claim,
though put in deprecating form, is made complacently
enough. The correlative is: &ldquo;You are so sensible,
dear; I know you won't mind,&rdquo; which is a formula
under cover of which many kindnesses may be shirked
and many unpleasant duties passed on.</p>

<p>The sensible, practical people who listen to these
sayings sometimes attach importance to them, so that
a habit has grown up of describing morbidly neurotic
people as &ldquo;over-sensitive&rdquo; and cowardly ones as &ldquo;too
quick of imagination.&rdquo; Ultimately, this leads to the
thought that both sensitiveness and imagination are
mental luxuries too costly for ordinary folk to grow,
and that it is safest to check, crush or uproot them
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg511" id="Pg511"></a>when we discover them springing up in others or in
ourselves.</p>

<p>Is not this attitude of mind due to a misunderstanding?
Imagination is an <i>organ of activity</i>; it can be
kept in the highest possible condition of health by
having plenty of exercise; it should be working continually
against resistance. A rabbit's gnawing tooth,
if the opposing tooth be broken, may grow inwards
and cause the creature's death, but the same activity of
growth, if working under suitable conditions, enables
him to go on living and gnawing at his food year after
year without wearing his tools away.</p>

<p>The problem, then, in economy of effort is: How shall
we use whatever force of sensitiveness and imagination
we have, so as to get its maximum efficiency of usefulness
and its minimum pain and inconvenience?</p>

<p>For many ages man has been dominated by fear.
His way to freedom, now, is to step out through his
cobweb chains and go right forward with courage and
in faith. So we are told with relentless and almost
tiresome reiteration. It is the fashion, one might
almost say, to have cast off fear, and the one thing an
honest &ldquo;modern thinker&rdquo; is afraid of is being afraid.
(To less honest ones it is the thought of <i>being thought</i>
afraid that is a very real and present fear.)</p>

<p>But, if this standpoint is right, is not fear at least
a vestigial organ, a survival of a mental activity which
served its purpose in times gone by? Is it not even
truer to go further still and say, as <i>each particular
fear</i> serves its purpose it may safely be discarded, but
that, as far as our present knowledge goes, other grades
of sensitiveness, finer shades of imagination of the type
we have called fear, must take its place, to be discarded
in their turn for yet other apprehensions?</p>

<p>For if we lost the kind of perception that we associate
with fear, if our imagination closed itself automatically
to the suggestion of all sorts of ugly possibilities, should
we not find ourselves soon in the midst of difficulties
akin to those of the hero of the German tale of the
man who felt no pain? We accept the evidence of pain
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg512" id="Pg512"></a>as a guide to action; when we have decided on action we
proceed to get rid of the pain as expeditiously, safely
and permanently as we can.</p>

<p>The same thing seems true of fear. Over and over
again we laugh at ourselves for fearing something that
either never happened at all or happened in such a way
as to be softened out of all likeness to the monstrous
terror we had created. On the other hand, when misfortune
falls heavily because of our lack of imagination
in not foreseeing possible consequences of particular
actions or events, we lament and complain: &ldquo;If I
could only have guessed! If I had only known!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fear pure and simple&mdash;the imagination of possible
trouble&mdash;is a stage we can hardly yet afford to do
without. But when it has roused our attention to a
danger, its work is done. Let us practise turning it
into action; taking due precautions against accident,
guarding against hurting a neighbour's feelings, watching
some possibility of evil tendency in ourselves. Then,
and not till then, may we let it drop. It may pass; it
has done its work. It is no longer our responsibility
to foresee, it is our privilege to lay down the fear and
live happily and at peace.</p>

<p>Even the dread perceptions of eternal laws come under
the same method. &ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom,&rdquo; the <i>beginning</i>: the end is faith
and love.</p>

which we published in the <a href="#Pg437">July number</a> has, as we

<h3 class="center">I</h3>

<p><span class="firstletter">A</span>s one who has tried the low proteid diet, and came to
grief on it, I desire to set my experience against that
of Mr Voysey,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and to assert that, if it is true for
him, it certainly is not true for me. Mr Voysey indulges
in many loose and generalised statements which do not
help the average man or woman in the least. I imagine
it is these that &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; has in mind when he advises
a certain standard of diet, below which it is not safe
to go. If Mr Voysey can, as Horace Fletcher can,
exist on a very low proteid diet, that does not prove
that all men and women can do the same and be healthily
active; it only shows that he and Fletcher are exceptions
to the average person, and that it may be dangerous
to follow their example. For most men, &ldquo;M.D.'s&rdquo;
proteid standard is not so nauseating as he finds it.
Here is a specimen dietary for a day, for a man of ten
stone, following, as most of us do, a sedentary occupation:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>3 oz. cheese.</li>
<li>9 oz. bread.</li>
<li>8 oz. vegetables and salad.</li>
<li>8 oz. fruit.</li>
<li>1&frac12; pints milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will any average person say that that quantity, divided
into three meals, would be nauseating to him? And
is that diet so very expensive that it would be beyond
the means of an agricultural labourer in any country?
It is certainly no mockery. The cost to such a labourer
would probably not exceed 3d. or 4d. Of course the diet
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg514" id="Pg514"></a>can be made as expensive as one chooses, and widely
varied.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9">[9]</a> See <a href="#HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT2">August number</a>.</p>

<p>Who amongst ordinary men and women has a reliable
natural taste that would be an infallible guide in all
matters of food? And what a misleading statement
that is which asserts &ldquo;that all the hardest work of the
world has always been done by those who get the least
food.&rdquo; Put it to the test on the average person and see
where it leads to.</p>

<p>My contention is that the average person, throwing
over his or her accustomed meat diet, requires some
definite guidance as to the quantity of proteid, such as
Dr Haig's wide experience and much patient research
have proved needful, or at least advisable, for the continuance
of a healthy and vigorous life; and I will say
that it does not help this average person in the least
to put before him the misty statement that &ldquo;the quantity
depends on the development that is in progress, and is
only discoverable by the natural guides of appetite and
taste, ruled by reason and love of others.&rdquo; All very
noble and very well in another place, but hardly meeting
the case of the ordinary person who is seeking a healthy
diet. Nor can you &ldquo;make the body a more harmonious
instrument for the true life of man&rdquo; by habitually underfeeding
it. I thought that was a medi&aelig;val notion that
had been knocked on the head long ago.</p>

<p>Is there any man, lay or scientific, Mr Voysey notwithstanding,
who can claim to have as wide an experience
of diet in its relation to health and disease as
&ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; to say nothing of the trained mind and long
years of patient thought that have been exerted in dealing
with the facts of this wide experience. For myself, I
have come to see that, if &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; does not hold in his
grasp the absolute truth in the matter of diet, he is
nearer to it, and is a safer guide, than all your low
proteid advisers, lay or otherwise, where they come
much below &ldquo;M.D.'s&rdquo; standard.</p>

<p>So, using Mr Voysey's phrases, I would urge laymen
like myself to shun that weak-kneed manikin, the low
proteid diet, and unite with me in a long strong pull
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg515" id="Pg515"></a>to get him and others like him out of the rut in which
that sorry weakling holds him.</p>

<p>The Editors were quite right in saying that the
<a href="#HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT1">article</a> under this heading in the <a href="#Pg437">July issue</a> would
arouse discussion. My wife and I, having discussed
&ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; and many others with the title, feel
constrained to put forth a warning against blind faith
in anything which the faculty have to say on dietetics.</p>

<p>There are of course brilliant exceptions, such as
Dr Rabagliati, Dr Knaggs, Dr Haig, the late Dr
Keith and others, who give chapter and verse for every
statement made; but when we consider the excellent
work of laymen such as Albert Broadbent, Joseph
Wallace, Horace Fletcher, Alice Braithwaite, Eustace
Miles, Hereward Carrington, Edgar J. Saxon, Bernarr
MacFadden, Arnold Eiloart, ordinary folks like ourselves
may be excused if we venture to give our experience
as against that of &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; men.</p>

<p>With your permission, then, we reply to &ldquo;M.D.'s&rdquo;
five suggestions in the order he gives them:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Food qualities are <i>not</i> of extreme importance.</p>

<p>2. Quantity tables may have been &ldquo;settled&rdquo; by
physiologists to their own satisfaction many years ago;
but very good reasons have since been given for altering,
or even ignoring, them.</p>

<p>3. The particular number of grains of proteid to be
consumed per day is not of serious moment.</p>

<p>4. That departure from the quantity specified has
not led to disaster is proved by the fact that the human
race still persists, in spite of the very varying eating
customs found in different nations. The great majority
being poor or ignorant, or both, know neither &ldquo;tables&rdquo;
nor the need for them.</p>

<p>5. There can be no reply to such a general statement
as: &ldquo;The nature of this disaster may appear to be very
various, and its real cause is thus frequently overlooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg516" id="Pg516"></a>In such matters an ounce of personal experience is
worth a pound of cut-and-dried theory. We&mdash;my wife
and I&mdash;have been reared in an atmosphere suspicious
of doctors, both sets of grandparents having relied
rather on herbs, water treatment, goodness of heart
and faith in God; and their children have had too
many evidences of medical ignorance to accept any
dogmas. We are anti-vaccinators, nearly vegetarian,
and, to come to the point, we have four children who
will persist in thriving on a basis of always too little
rather than too much of food. The respective ages
are girl 13, boy 10, girl 6, boy 2.</p>

<p>All have been brought up on these lines: never
pressed to eat, but continually asked to chew thoroughly.
Foods &ldquo;rich in proteid&rdquo; put sparingly before them.
Milk has been well watered; and eggs, bacon and other
tempting and rich foods only on rare occasions given
to them.</p>

<p>We would ask readers who can to make the following
experiment: Let your children have a good drink to
start the day, and then run and play; don't offer food
till asked for. You will almost to a certainty find, if you
start this plan immediately after weaning, that day by
day and year after year it is twelve to one o'clock before
they inquire for &ldquo;something to eat.&rdquo; We have done
this for twelve years, with children of entirely different
temperament and of both sexes. They go to school,
poor things! breakfastless. During these twelve years
light breakfast for father has been on the table&mdash;he
goes without lunch&mdash;and not once in fifty do they ask
to join him. Nor, if invited, will they after three or four
years of age.</p>

<p>The have never had a fever which lasted more than
a day or two, and they are all above average height and
weight.</p>

<p>They get fruit in season just as asked for, and as
much to drink as they like, <i>but not at meal-times</i>.</p>

<p>Our experience is over a period of twelve years, and
we have come to the conclusion that the infectious
diseases so prevalent and death-dealing amongst chil<a class="pagenum" name="Pg517" id="Pg517"></a>dren
of all classes, rich or poor, are, in the main, the
result of over-feeding. We find it wise to keep highly
nutritious foods (like eggs, cheese, meat, etc.) away
from children&mdash;that is, for regular consumption; a little
occasionally may do no harm.</p>

<p>You will have it borne in on our minds year by
year, as your children grow up under such a plan, that
Dr Rabagliati, Hereward Carrington and others are
quite right. We do not get our strength, nor heat,
from food. Let the force of animal life (zoo-dynamic,
I believe Dr Rabagliati calls it) have free play, and your
children can't help growing up well and strong.</p>

<p>In to-day's <i>London Daily Chronicle</i> I see a special
article by Dr Saleeby, under this heading: <span class="smcap">World's
Doctors versus Disease. 5000 Medical Men Meet
To-day. The Triumphs of Three Decades.</span> We
know how much this wonderful faculty knew thirty
years ago about, <i>e.g.</i>, fresh air for consumptives.
There is not a word said in this article (which is a sort
of programme of the weighty matters for discussion) on
the relation of food to the body. That question probably
4950 of them believe was settled by the eminent
physiologists who compiled those &ldquo;food-tables&rdquo; years
ago&mdash;and in so doing went far to pave the way for the
modern frightful increase of cancer, Bright's disease,
etc., as well as for &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; horrors like anti-toxin,
tuberculin&mdash;not to mention compulsory eugenics!</p>

<h2><a name="HEALTH_THROUGH_READING" id="HEALTH_THROUGH_READING"></a>HEALTH THROUGH READING.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">D</span>o many people consider reading from the point
of view of health of mind and body&mdash;of refreshment
in times of struggle&mdash;of recuperation after
knock-down blows of sorrow, disappointment or misfortune?</p>

<p>Let us begin by saying that some of the greatest
books are not to be read by everybody at all seasons.
When one's heart or ankles are weak, one does not
start to climb mountains, or one may end as a corpse
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg518" id="Pg518"></a>or a cripple. So with one's soul under shock or stress.
Personally, I can imagine nothing more cruel than the
action of two women, one a story-teller of great repute
among the &ldquo;goody,&rdquo; who, to a specially stricken and
lonely young widow, tendered as &ldquo;bed-side books,&rdquo;
Victor Hugo's <i>Les Miserables</i> and Browning's poignant
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>. If they had wished to
make her realise to the bitterest depths the awfulness
of the world wherein she was left alone, and the
blackest depravity of the human nature around her,
they could not have done differently. <i>Les Miserables</i>
she read till she reached the dreadful scene where a
vicious cad hurls snowballs at the helpless Fantine.
Then the strong instinct of self-preservation made her
put the book aside&mdash;not to touch it again for nearly
thirty years. With <i>The Ring and the Book</i> her mind
was too wrung and too weary to wrestle&mdash;all it could
receive was a picture of wronged innocence, and
especially of the rampant forces of evil with which she
was left to contend. With the same want of tact and
judgment, if with unconscious cruelty, the gloomy,
fateful <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> was selected out of all
Scott's novels for the reading of a very homesick youth,
solitary in a strange country!</p>

<p>Yet we must always remember that, as in affairs of
the body so of the spirit, &ldquo;what is one man's meat
may be another man's poison.&rdquo; Some of the wisest
and most successful nurses or doctors will occasionally
permit an invalid to indulge in a longed-for diet which
would certainly never be prescribed. They know that
idiosyncrasy follows no exactly known rule. So we could
tell of one who, amid the dry agnosticism of the later
half of last century, had felt her faith, not indeed extinguished,
but obscured and darkened. From the perusal
of certain writers she had shrunk, perhaps with
cowardice. They were put on such a pinnacle that she
feared she would find no arguments fit to oppose
to theirs. Weakly, she locked the skeleton cupboard.
Then she was attacked by a malady which, while
leaving her mind free and strong, she knew might be
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg519" id="Pg519"></a>very speedily fatal. Straightway she said to her husband:
&ldquo;In two or three days I shall probably &lsquo;know&rsquo;&mdash;or
cease from all knowing. There will not be long
to wait. Therefore bring me three books,&rdquo; which she
named, works of authors of extreme agnostic views.
Rather reluctantly he complied with her wish. She
went steadily through the joyless pages, turned the last
with the significant remark: &ldquo;If this is all they can
say, well!&mdash;&rdquo; The skeleton cupboard, once opened,
was speedily swept out. She quickly recovered, but
never forgot her experience. Yet it must be remembered
that this was the patient's own prescription, and
was permitted by one who thoroughly understood her
temperament. Therefore, though one would never wish
to overrule a strong personal desire, that is quite different
from offering counsel and furtherance&mdash;or proving
experiments upon oneself.</p>

<p>A celebrated woman writer of the middle of last
century was of opinion that young people of both sexes
should not indulge in reading &ldquo;minor poetry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let
them keep to the great poets, made of granite,&rdquo; was her
graphic phrase. A woman of singularly self-controlled
nature has confessed that the only time in her whole
life that she experienced an unwholesome moral and
emotional disturbance, after reading a book, was when,
at about twenty-two years of age, she read Emily
Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. She dared not finish it:
and when, some time later, a copy was presented to
her, she caused it to be exchanged for another book,
not wishing it even to be in the house with her. Years
afterwards, she read it again, quite unmoved. It may
be added that her first reading was made in the course
of a systematic study of English literature, which had
already led her through the works of Chaucer and
Fielding. She has herself asked: &ldquo;Is it possible that
the strong and unpleasant effect was produced because
the book was the production of another young woman,
perhaps of somewhat &lsquo;sympathetic&rsquo; temperament?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, probably most fiction and all highly
emotional work of any sort should be indulged in
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg520" id="Pg520"></a>sparingly by those in the danger-zone of life, or by any
under special mental or moral stress. History, philosophy
(with sustained chains of reasoning) and biographies
(best, autobiographies) of active and strenuous
lives, should be resorted to by those temporarily doomed
to spells of suspense and involuntary inaction. Invalids
should be encouraged to read Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> rather
than the <i>Memorials</i> of other sufferers, however saintly!</p>

<p>It may be broadly stated that, during the tragic
episodes which seem to occur in all lives, the most
wholesome reading is to be found in the books of the
great World-Religions&mdash;the Bible, and the teachings of
Buddha, Confucius and Mahomet. The Bible is of
course a library in itself, and many of its books are
suited to very widely different circumstances and temperaments.
The Psalms, the Gospels, the Epistle of
St James, and parts of those great poems known as the
&ldquo;prophetical books&rdquo; and the more personal and less
doctrinal portions of Paul's epistles are perhaps of
widest application. From the words of Buddha, Confucius
and Mahomet there are many admirable selections&mdash;and
one remembers a wonderful compilation of more
than thirty years ago, called <i>The Sacred Anthology</i>,
and wonders if it be out of print. It does not follow
that these works should not be studied at other times
than &ldquo;tragic episodes.&rdquo; If this were more often the
case, perhaps there would be fewer &ldquo;tragic episodes&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Next to these come such wonderful books of spiritual
experience as &Agrave; Kempis's <i>Imitation of Christ</i>, the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, the <i>Devout Life</i> of Francis of Sales
and others which will occur to the memory.</p>

<p>Allusion to the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> brings us to the
remark that no books are more truly wholesome than
some that can be enjoyed by those of all ages, and of
very varied types of &ldquo;culture&rdquo;: in which the children
can delight, and which refresh the aged and weary.
Like Nature herself, they have hedgerows where the
little ones can gather flowers, little witting of the
farther horizons of earth and sky lifted up for the eyes
of the elders. Let the children read the <i>Pilgrim's
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg521" id="Pg521"></a>Progress</i> simply as &ldquo;a story,&rdquo; its eternal verities will
sink into their souls to reappear when they too are in
<i>Vanity Fair</i> or in bitter conflict with <i>Apollyon</i>.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the Book of Proverbs should be
commended to youthful study. Under wise supervision&mdash;or
rather, in mutual study&mdash;it becomes at once a
series of vivid pictures of primitive Eastern life&mdash;for all
allusions should be explained, where possible, pictorially&mdash;while
at the same time the memory will be insensibly
stored with shrewd common sense and knowledge of the
world, to be turned to, and drawn upon, as needed.</p>

<p>And then, while the children revel in the fun and the
fancy of Hans Andersen's <i>Fairy Tales</i>, let the sorrowful
or sore or wounded heart turn to them for solace,
soothing or healing. Hans Andersen enjoys a very
special &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; and yet some, who have learned
to love and value him, doubt whether justice has yet
been done to his work. Because it is matchless for the
young, it may be easily forgotten that it can be so,
only by some quality which makes it matchless for all
others. Perhaps some of his most popular stories are
not his most wonderful, but have simply caught the
popular fancy, because of some artist's illustration, or
some personal application to the writer's own history,
as in the case of his <i>Ugly Duckling</i>. How many&mdash;or
rather, how few!&mdash;can readily recall the pathos and wit
of his <i>Portuguese Duck</i> or the deep philosophy of his
<i>Girl Who Trod on a Loaf</i>?</p>

<p>It is told of Hans Andersen, a gentle soul in a
homely exterior, which attracted the snubs and neglect
which &ldquo;patient merit of the unworthy takes,&rdquo; on some
such occasion was once heard to murmur: &ldquo;And yet
I am the greatest man now in the world!&rdquo; It was very
naive of him to say so, even in a whisper, probably
wrung from him only in self-defence, but perhaps he
might have thought it, in solemn silence&mdash;and&mdash;not been
so very wrong! It may have been part of the very
transparency of his inspired genius that he could not
keep the secret to himself!</p>

<p>There is at least one reader who declares that she
finds the seeds of all vital philosophy&mdash;ancient or
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg522" id="Pg522"></a>modern&mdash;in his stories. How much he derived from
those who went before him, it is not for us to say, but
this disciple, herself a devoted student and admirer of
the world's latest teacher, Leo Tolstoy, yet puts Hans
Andersen above him, as having attained in practically
all his work what Tolstoy attained only occasionally&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
Tolstoy's own ideal of what Art should be and do.</p>

<p>In such a paper as this little can be done beyond
indicating on the broadest lines the kind of reading
which tends to preserve or to restore mental health.
Away with your &ldquo;problem&rdquo; novels and &ldquo;realistic&rdquo;
poems stated in the filthy material of moral gutters!
Hans Andersen will take some birds, some flowers, some
toys, and will state the same problems, and get the
same eternal solutions, without making the inquirer
run any risk of meanwhile catching moral malaria.
Isaiah will help us to build &ldquo;castles&rdquo; for the human race
and for our own future, but he will take care that we
shall remember that righteousness and unceasing vigilance
and unflagging repair must go into the laying
of foundations and the upholding of walls. David,
even in his &ldquo;cursing psalms,&rdquo; will exemplify for
you the power of hate and vengeance in your own
heart, and as he holds it up before you, you will see
how small a thing it is, how mean, how ludicrous!</p>

<p>As a man eats and drinks, so is his body: if he is a
gross feeder, his body will be gross and sensual; if his
food lacks nourishment, he will pine and fade. So it is
with our minds and our morals. With whatever
original &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; we may start, it needs
spiritual sustenance, spiritual discipline, spiritual sufficiency
and spiritual abstinence. Too often we ill-use it,
as bodies are ill-used, goading its weakness with fiery
excitement, or gorging its greed with sickly sentiment,
or emasculating it by empty frivolity.</p>

<p>All who desire spiritual health must find out what
books best promote it in themselves: and sometimes
they are found, like wholesome herbs, in very lowly
places. One good rule is never to recommend what
we have not seen proved in ourselves, or on others.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_QUEST_FOR_BEAUTY" id="THE_QUEST_FOR_BEAUTY"></a>THE QUEST FOR BEAUTY.</h2>


<p><span class="firstletter">I</span>f you have travelled at all frequently on certain of
the London &ldquo;tube&rdquo; railways you may occasionally
have noticed, facing you in the carriage, a small
framed poster which for beauty and imaginative power
has, I should think, never been surpassed in advertising
art. If the first sight of it did not make you catch your
breath you will not, I am afraid, be interested in this
article.</p>

<p>The poster represents a rich landscape, in which
noble tree-forms show sombre against a tumultuous sky&mdash;the
latter an architectural mass of pale cloud, spanned
by a vivid rainbow. Across the lower part of the
picture is a scroll, on which are written, in musical
notation, two bars from Chopin's Twentieth Prelude.
At the top are the words, <i>Studies in Harmony</i>: it is an
advertisement of Somebody &amp; Co.'s wall-papers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg524" id="Pg524"></a>In both colour and design this poster is very beautiful.
It would be scarcely less so without the rainbow; but
&ldquo;the dazzling prism of the sky&rdquo; not only intensifies
the subtle harmony of colour throughout the picture:
it turns the poster into a symbol. And the artist
might well have stopped there; only, you see, he had
an inspiration. When he wrote across the picture those
eight descending chords from the immortal <i>Largo</i> he
made of the poster&mdash;a poem.</p>

<p>I do not know anything about the artist who conceived
this advertisement of wall-papers. I do not
even know his name. But I believe him to be the
herald of an invasion.</p>

<p>The invasion of life by beauty.</p>

<p>Do you think it a degradation of art that it should
be enlisted by the makers of wall-papers? Are there
not too many ugly and discordant posters? Do you
consider trade and manufacture so sordid that they
are beneath the ministrations of beauty? It doesn't
matter a new penny whether you answer such questions
with a nod or a no: the invasion has begun. It is
irresistible. Beauty is stooping&mdash;stooping to conquer.</p>

<p>Your ardent social reformer is too often obsessed
with one idea. Across his mental firmament he sees
only one blazing word: <span class="smcap">Injustice.</span> And, fine fellow
though he often is, he is inclined to be impatient with
any talk of art or beauty. &ldquo;How can beauty grow in
these vile cities?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;What is the use of
your music, your statuary, your fine pictures, your
poetry, to the starving and the oppressed?&rdquo; And he
does not see that his passionate desire for justice is at
root the quest for beauty, for fullness and harmony
of life. His stormy sky shows no rainbow: yet it is
there. And so is the stately music, the transmutation
of colour into sound. And if his eyes could be opened
to one and his ears to the other, there would be more
power to his elbow. For beauty is inspiration and
courage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My heart leaps up when I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rainbow in the sky....&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg525" id="Pg525"></a>And there is more than that in it. The cultivation of
a sense of beauty, of harmony, makes reformers less
harsh in their judgments, broadens their sympathies
and helps to save them from becoming mere doctrinaires.
If you have any love for the beautiful you
simply cannot be happy about most Utopias, though
they be Justice itself in civic form; and, when our
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; Fabian has demonstrated to you how to
organise the national life in all its parts into one vast
smoothly working State mechanism you will shudder,
and then laugh. And then, without any rudeness, you
will say: &ldquo;Hang mechanism and a minimum wage!
Live men and women want living crafts, liberty and a
maximum beauty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And really, I am coming to see that there are a great
many health-culture enthusiasts (not to mention food
reformers) who see no rainbow in the sky and hear no
music in the wind; and even if they did, ten to one they
would see no connection between the two. I verily
believe there are some poor souls who have studied
food questions so closely that they cannot see the sun
for proteid nor the sea for salts. In all meekness, and
knowing the frailty of the human mind (I have written
dozens of articles on diet!), I would prescribe for them
a course of artistic wall-paper advertisements, combined
with the letters of Robert Louis Stevenson. He, poor
fellow, had to battle against disease all his short life;
but he managed to end one of his letters something like
this (I quote from memory): &ldquo;<i>Sursum Corda</i>! Heave
ahead! Art and blue heaven! April and God's larks!
A stately music.... Enter God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A somewhat ecstatic utterance. A trifle too exclamatory.
Perhaps. You and I don't end our letters
like that. (Or do you?) More likely we say something
about the weather down here being miserably cold (or
damp, or dull, or changeable, or hot) and brave out the
lie with &ldquo;yours truly.&rdquo; But O for one little spark
from the fire that shone in the soul of R.L.S. Better
to die young with a broken heart, if it were a heart as
brave and gay as his, than beat Methuselah by means
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg526" id="Pg526"></a>of a mincing, calculating, cold-blooded attention to
irritating self-made little rules.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I know well the value of little rules. And
I know also that Nature offers us only two alternatives&mdash;obedience
or death (either sudden or slow). But then
Nature is something more than Mistress and Lawgiver.
She is Beauty. And in that aspect, as in all other
aspects, Nature is unescapable. We turn our backs
on her only to find her awaiting us at the next turn in
the road. Looking at the matter all round, I don't
think we can come to any other conclusion than that
Nature (or whatever you like to call It, Her or Him) is
aiming at beauty all the time. So that we who are
literally, if not figuratively, the children of Nature, had
best do likewise.</p>

<p>Some mystic or other has said that man's search
for God is God's search for man. If he was right&mdash;and
I think he was&mdash;it follows that man's quest for
beauty is Beauty invading life; and that the only healthy
life worth the having is that which begins with &ldquo;Lift
up your hearts!&rdquo; and issues in &ldquo;a stately music.
Enter God.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">XXI. Hired Help</span> (<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<p><span class="firstletter">W</span>hat is the homemaker of limited means, who
must have some help, to do under present
conditions? Well, meantime, there is only the
young &ldquo;general&rdquo; for her, either the &ldquo;daily girl&rdquo; or
one who &ldquo;lives in.&rdquo; Of the two I prefer the &ldquo;daily
girl,&rdquo; when she can be obtained. And the younger she
can be obtained, other things equal, the better. She
will have fewer bad habits to overcome. Some housewives
object to the daily girl on the score that she may
bring dirt or infection from her home, and also because
she can seldom arrive early enough to help get breakfast.
But a little management overnight can reduce
the labour of breakfast getting to a minimum, and if
the &ldquo;outings&rdquo; of the girl who lives in are as frequent
as they ought to be the risk of her carrying infection,
etc., will always apply.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;daily girl&rdquo; has definitely fixed hours of work
and the same chance of enjoying a measure of home
life, of keeping her friends and individual interests, as
the typist or factory worker whose lot the domestic
servant so often envies; while her employers are not
faced with the alternatives of condemning a young
fellow-creature to a solitary existence or forcing an
unreal companionship which is equally irksome on both
sides. It is true that the wages of the &ldquo;daily girl&rdquo;
do not equal, in actual money, those of the factory
worker, neither does she obtain the Saturday half-holiday
or the whole of Sunday free. But to set against
this she receives her entire board and, with a kindly
mistress, is not tied down to staying her full time on
days when she is &ldquo;forward&rdquo; with her work.</p>

<p>The life of the young &ldquo;daily girl,&rdquo; if her employer
is a conscientious woman, need not be hard nor unpleasant;
very little harder and no more unpleasant
than the lot of the young &ldquo;lady&rdquo; who is paying from
&pound;60 to &pound;80 per annum to learn cookery, laundry and
housework at a school of domestic economy. Properly
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg529" id="Pg529"></a>conducted, the relations between employer and employee,
&ldquo;mistress&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant,&rdquo; are those of mutual aid.
Such relations <i>may</i> be, and too often <i>are</i>, those of an
inefficient little drudge for a &ldquo;mistress&rdquo; almost equally
ignorant and inefficient. But when the employer is
an intelligent woman with a sense of justice (I prefer
a sense of justice to sentimental theories about sisterhood&mdash;people
do not always treat their sisters justly)
the weekly money payment and food will be but a small
part of the girl's wage. In addition she will receive
a training that will equip her for the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; branches
of domestic service, or for homemaking on her own
account. Not every girl has the sense to appreciate this
when she gets it, nor the intelligence to profit by it;
while it is certainly rather trying to the employer when
the girl is &ldquo;all agog&rdquo; to &ldquo;better herself&rdquo; as soon
as she has gained a bare smattering of how to do
certain things properly. But all this is &ldquo;the fortune
of war.&rdquo; Some girls never cease to be grateful to their
first teachers and leave them reluctantly, while other
girls never realise that they have anything to be grateful
for. When gratitude and affection come they are
pleasant to receive. But the motive power of the really
conscientious woman is not the expectation of gratitude
or affection.</p>

<p>A word to the unconventional homemaker. The
young &ldquo;general&rdquo; is a bird of passage. Age and
experience bring with them the necessity of earning
more, and if her first employer cannot periodically raise
the girl's wages the latter must in time seek better
paid employment, probably with a mistress who is not
unconventional. It is unkind, therefore, to refrain
from teaching the girl how she will be expected to do
things in the ordinary conventional house. I do not
mean that the employer ought to slavishly run her
home on conventional lines for the instruction of her
&ldquo;help.&rdquo; But it is kinder, for instance, to help a girl
regard a cap and apron with good-humoured indifference,
or as on a par with a nurse's uniform, rather
than as &ldquo;a badge of servitude.&rdquo; It is kinder, too, to
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg530" id="Pg530"></a>show her that it is not only &ldquo;servants&rdquo; who are
expected to address their employers as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; but that well-mannered young people in all
conditions of life can be found who use this form of
address to persons older than themselves. I do not
suggest for one moment that any attempt should be
made to delude a girl into the belief that she will not
be expected, in conventional households, to behave with
equal deference to persons younger than herself. Such
deception would be unpardonable. But it is anything
but kind to allow a young girl to drift into careless and
familiar habits of speech bound to lead to dismissal
for &ldquo;impudence&rdquo; in her next &ldquo;place.&rdquo; There is a
type of person, for example, who seems to believe that,
in order to show that he is &ldquo;as good as anybody else,&rdquo; it
is necessary to be rude and familiar. But good manners
are not necessarily associated with servility. And it
is no kindness to help to unfit a girl for getting her
living in the world as it is.</p>

<p>It may seem that, in this article, I am more concerned
for the &ldquo;hired help&rdquo; than the homemaker for whom
I am ostensibly writing. But the points I have touched
on are just those about which I know many thoughtful
women are puzzled. I cannot solve their individual
problems for them, of course, I can only just barely
indicate some of the thoughts that have come to me
on a subject that is so intimately bound up with the
whole of our present unsatisfactory social and economic
conditions that it cannot be adequately discussed in
a little tract upon domestic economy.</p>

<h3><a name="Cupboards" id="Cupboards"></a><span class="smcap">The Care Of Cupboards.</span></h3>

<p>There are three methods in general use of caring for
cupboards. Some housewives prefer their cupboard
shelves of bare wood, to be well scrubbed with soap
and water at the periodical &ldquo;turn-out.&rdquo; Others cover
all shelves with white American cloth, which only needs
wiping over with a wet house-flannel; while still others
prefer to dispense with the necessity for wetting the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg531" id="Pg531"></a>shelves and line them with white kitchen paper, or even
clean newspaper, which is periodically renewed.</p>

<p>Of the three methods I prefer the last, with the
addition of a good scrubbing at the spring clean. The
weekly or fortnightly scrubbing is apt to result in
permanently damp cupboards, unless they can be left
empty to dry for a longer time than is usually convenient.
The use of American cloth is perhaps the
easiest, most labour-saving method, but the cloth soon
gets superficially marked and worn long before its real
usefulness is impaired, so that the cupboard shelves
never look quite so neat as after scrubbing or relining
with white paper.</p>

<p>The larder should be thoroughly &ldquo;turned out&rdquo; once
a week. Once a fortnight is enough for the store-cupboard
and for china cupboards in daily use. While
cupboards in which superfluous china and other non-perishable
goods are stored, and that are seldom opened,
need not be touched oftener than once or twice a year.</p>

<p>In very small houses one cupboard often must house
both china and groceries, thus combining the offices of
storeroom and china cupboard. The larder, strictly
speaking, is for the food consumed daily. But when
larder and store-cupboard have to be combined, the
groceries may be packed away on the upper shelves,
which can be tidied once a fortnight; but the shelves
doing duty for the larder proper should never be left
for longer than a week.</p>

<p>Nothing betrays the careless housewife like an ill-smelling
larder. All food should be examined daily
and kept well covered. Hot food should be allowed to
cool before storing in the larder. In the summer time
special precautions must be taken against flies, all
receptacles for food which are minus well-fitting lids
being covered with wire-gauze covers or clean butter
muslin. If the shelves are lined with paper, care should
be taken at the weekly change to examine the wood for
stains caused by spilt food that has penetrated through
the paper. These should not be just left and covered
over, but well washed off. With ordinary carefulness,
however, they need not occur.</p>

<p class="book"><i>The New Suggestion Treatment.</i> By J. Stenson Hooker,
M.D. Cloth 1s. net (postage 1&frac12;d.) C.W. Daniel,
Ltd., 3 Tudor Street, E.C.</p>

<p>This book is a striking example of the new synthetic
movement in the medical profession. It is an exposition
for the general reader of certain basic principles
of mental treatment and of the author's methods of
applying these; it is also, in reality, an appeal to doctors
generally to put aside prejudice and examine the immense
potentialities of rational &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; healing
methods.</p>

<p>After examining the main features and disadvantages
of mere hypnotic treatment and passing under review
present-day &ldquo;mental science,&rdquo; the author explains
wherein his method of mental treatment both avoids the
dangers of hypnotism and reinforces ordinary self-suggestion.
Throughout there is the frank recognition
that few forms of dis-ease are curable by
one means alone; on the other hand, it is contended that
most disorders, both mental and physical, are remarkably
amenable to a rightly directed course of the new
suggestion treatment, supplemented by other natural
means.</p>

<p>The narrowness of view that too often characterises
the specialist is entirely absent from this book. It is
throughout thoroughly broad, refreshingly sensible and
profoundly convincing.</p>

<p class="book"><i>The Cottage Farm Month by Month</i> (illustrated with original
photographs). By F.E. Green. Cloth, 1s. net (postage 2d.). C.W.
Daniel, Ltd., 3 Tudor Street, London, E.C.</p>

<p>Here is a book of immediate social interest, of great
practical value, and of uncommon literary quality.</p>

<p>In the course of twelve chapters, bearing the titles of
the months of the year, it reveals a welding together of
two things which in many minds have unfortunately
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg533" id="Pg533"></a>become divorced: the practical problems and arduous
labour which no tiller of the soil can escape and&mdash;the
keen delight of a poetical temperament in the ever-changing,
yet annually renewed, beauties of earth and
sky and running water.</p>

<p>It escapes the dry technicalities of the agricultural
text-book, while at the same time conveying innumerable
valuable hints on practically every branch of &ldquo;small
farming&rdquo;&mdash;advice which springs from the author's
thorough knowledge based on long and often hard
experience.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while entirely free from that all
too common defect of &ldquo;nature-books&rdquo;&mdash;hot-house
enthusiasm&mdash;it will delight the most incurable townsman
(providing his sense of beauty is not withered)
by its joyous yet restrained pictures of open-air things.</p>

<p class="book"><i>Simple Rules of Health.</i> By Philip Oyler, M.A. (2nd
ed.). 3d. net. Post free from the author, Morshin
School, Headley, Hants.</p>

<p>An admirable epitome of what might be called &ldquo;advanced
health culture without crankiness.&rdquo; The author
is an ardent advocate of simplicity in all things
and&mdash;practises what he preaches. Moreover, he is one of
those who sees health from all points of view: he is as
much concerned with what the English Bible calls &ldquo;a
right spirit&rdquo; as with a fit body and a responsive mind.
It is a little book deserving of a wide circulation.</p>

<p class="corresp">Would you care to publish the following experience
of a cure for sleeplessness:&mdash;</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in going to sleep, but usually awoke

took me two or three hours to go to sleep again.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg534" id="Pg534"></a>I cured myself in the following way: I left off supper
and reduced my tea meal by half, and the result was
continuous sleep; the symptoms, however, began to
come back again after a time, so I gradually cut the tea
meal right away, and half of the midday meal as well.
The cure was then permanent and after a time I found
that I could resume the tea meal again. At the present
time I am having a tea meal of fruit only.</p>

<p>In addition I should advise those who suffer from this
complaint to keep cheerful, and to avoid excessive
physical or mental fatigue and worry. Yours faithfully,</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Lime" id="Lime"></a>IS PURE LIME JUICE OBTAINABLE?</h3>

<p>The Editors have received the following letter from
Messrs Rowntree &amp; Co., Ltd.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:8%;"><p>&ldquo;We note in your issue of <a href="#Pg437">July 1913</a> under the heading of
&lsquo;Lemon or Orange Squash&rsquo; a <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: I am unable to find this note.">note</ins> to the effect that bottled
lemon squashes and lime cordials &lsquo;are not pure in the strict
sense of the term, since they are bound to contain 10 per
cent. alcoholic pure spirit by Government regulations.&rsquo; We
should be glad to know what is your authority for this
statement. Possibly it is a misprint, because obviously the
Government does not require anything of the kind. Our own
lemon squash and lime juice cordial are entirely free from
any form of preservative, including alcohol. They are made
up from pure lemon juice and lime juice respectively, with
sugar, and contain no foreign ingredient.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The statement complained of was based on an article
entitled &ldquo;Fortified Lime Juice&rdquo; which appeared in <i>The
Chemist and Druggist</i>, 13th May 1911 (page 51). On
again referring to this article we find that the Government
regulation applies only to <i>exported</i> Lime Juice.</p>

<p>We regret having made this error, and are genuinely
glad to have Messrs Rowntree's assurance that their
own &ldquo;Lime Juice Cordial&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lemon Squash&rdquo; are
&ldquo;entirely free from any form of preservative, including
alcohol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we think our suspicions regarding the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg535" id="Pg535"></a>presence of preservatives in such articles are justifiable
in view of the following authoritative statements made
by <i>The Chemist and Druggist</i> in the article referred
to:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left:8%;"><p>&ldquo;The British Revenue authorities have drawn the line a
little tighter in the discharge of their responsibility respecting
the soundness of lime-juice intended for exportation or for use
on board ship. The new rule henceforth is to grant a &lsquo;pass&rsquo;
certificate for unfortified lime-juice to last for fourteen days
only, at the end of which time another certificate must be
obtained. As this new regulation affects lime-juice in its
natural condition before rum or any other spirit is added to
it, only lime-juice manufacturers or importers are concerned
in the matter.... <i>With such rapidly deteriorating liquid as
lime or lemon juice the addition of the preservative spirit is
a necessity, hence the sooner it is fortified the better.</i> The
Revenue authorities permit duty-free spirit to be used for this
purpose, but in order that lime-juice manufacturers shall have
this advantage of not paying duty on the spirit used the
Revenue authorities insist on approval of the juice and its
subsequent fortification in bond under supervision of the
Crown.... In reference to the proportion of spirit
used, previously the regulation was expressed in a
permissive sense, but now the emphatic &ldquo;must&rdquo; is used. In
the last Government Laboratory report it was stated that
396 samples were examined, most of which were lime-juice,
representing nearly 50,000 gallons. Even the fortified article
is re-tested if more than three months old in cask or two
years old in bottle, and this re-testing resulted last year in a
condemnation of several hundred gallons owing to deterioration
during storage. This juice is principally for use in the
Mercantile Marine to combat scurvy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>From which it would appear that the use of <i>some</i>
kind of preservative is essential with such a rapidly
deteriorating liquid as lime or lemon juice; and if not
alcohol, there are innumerable chemical preservatives
available. We wish we could rely on receiving assurances
from other &ldquo;Lime Juice&rdquo; importers and manufacturers
similar to that we have received from Messrs
Rowntree.</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Faulty" id="Faulty"></a>FAULTY FOOD COMBINATIONS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>H.E.H. writes.&mdash;I should like your opinion of the statement of
the late Mr A. Broadbent, that fruit when taken with starchy
food by dyspeptics delays digestion, and that the digestion of
starchy foods and vegetables occupied only one-third of the time
needed for the digestion of starch with fruit. I have lived on a
strict vegetarian diet and observed the laws of hygiene for two
and a half years, to rid myself of dyspepsia, with great success,
having increased my weight by thirty-six pounds; for the last nine
months of this time I have lived on a largely &ldquo;unfired&rdquo; diet, but
am still troubled with acid risings and flatulence and cannot
account for it. Will you kindly enlighten me on the subject?</p>

<p>I am a carpenter by trade and get eight hours in the open air
every day. I take a tumbler of distilled water hot with the juice
of one orange at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, breakfast at 7.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, dinner at 12 noon
and tea at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, all consisting of Wallace unfermented bread and
biscuits, various fruits (mostly apples, bananas and tomatoes) and
nuts, about &frac12;oz. at a meal; also a little cheese, about 1 oz. at a
meal.</p></blockquote>

<p>The late Mr A. Broadbent was quite right, in my
opinion, when he asserted that fruit taken with starchy
foods delayed digestion.</p>

<p>To reap the true benefit from fruit it must be taken
alone.</p>

<p>The dominant element in fruit is oxygen and the
feature of oxygen is its power to start the process of
oxidation in decomposing and disintegrating substances.
It follows that when the stomach is filled with ferment<a class="pagenum" name="Pg537" id="Pg537"></a>ing
food-stuffs, or the tissues are clogged with the
products derived from such, the oxidising action of
fruit will be correspondingly intense.</p>

<p>The Naturist who applies the Schroth Cure for the
purpose of curing chronic diseases uses fruit as his chief
eliminating agent. The reader will remember that the
peasant healer, Schroth, made his patients take dry
stale rolls alone for three whole days, with nothing
whatever to drink, and on the fourth day, he gave them
a full bottle of white wine, which then caused intense
oxidation, with marked elimination of poisons. His
methods, if successful, were drastic and weakening, and
so the latter-day exponents of Schrothism have modified
this and give their patients zweiback or twice-baked
bread instead of rolls, and on the third or fourth day
make the patient partake freely of fresh fruit. This
process of alternate dry days and fluid days is continued
for some weeks until the cure is complete.</p>

<p>I have merely referred to this matter to show the
part played by fruit in the body. To a healthy person
fruit is in truth a splendid regenerating food, but it
should, whenever possible, be eaten alone. To a dyspeptic,
fruit is often equally good, if <i>taken by itself</i>.</p>

<p>The case of vegetables is different, and I hold with
Broadbent that salad or properly cooked vegetables do
go well with cereals, because they contain, not oxygen
and oxygen acids, but mineral elements like soda, lime
and magnesia, which neutralise the acids and toxins
which form in the body as a result of its work. The
vegetable is just as active as the fruit as an eliminant,
but it works on different lines. Cereal foods, if eaten
slowly in a dry condition are made alkaline by the
saliva, so that the vegetables, which are also naturally
alkaline, would harmonise well with cereals if eaten
with them.</p>

<p>Our correspondent should modify his diet as follows,
and then, I anticipate, he will cease to be troubled with
his acid dyspepsia and flatulence. He should take his
fruit alone, and take any of the crisp unsweetened
Wallace &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; Biscuits in preference to the un<a class="pagenum" name="Pg538" id="Pg538"></a>fermented
bread, which latter is often difficult to
digest:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;A tumblerful of hot distilled water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast</i> (at 7.30).&mdash;Fresh fruit only.</p>

<p><i>Lunch</i> (at 12).&mdash;1 to 2 oz. of cheese, preferably home-made
curd cheese; salad of green leaf vegetables;
&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; or Ixion biscuits with fresh butter, or nut
butter.</p>

<p><i>Dinner</i> (at 6).&mdash;1 to 2 oz. of flaked pine kernels, finely
grated raw roots or tomatoes, with pure olive oil;
Granose biscuits, or Shredded Wheat biscuits, and
fresh butter.</p>

<p><i>At bedtime.</i>&mdash;Cupful of dandelion coffee or hot distilled
water.</p>

<blockquote><p>E.M.A. writes.&mdash;At the age of five years I had an attack of
rheumatic fever through taking a severe cold, and have been
troubled more or less with pains since that time, which I feel sure
are caused through rheumatism of the nerves. I am now fifty-eight
years of age and have been a vegetarian for six years.</p>

<p>My diet is:&mdash;8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, cup of Sanum Tonic Tea; 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Cup of

<p>Neuritis is a painful and wearying form of nerve
trouble which mostly affects the arms and legs. It
can, however, originate in any other part of the body
through the spinal nerve centres. It may sometimes
be due to injury, but the usual cause is some form of
thickening or misplacement of the spinal structures,
which induces pressure upon the nerves as they emerge
through the apertures between the spinal bones. A
careful examination of the back will show the site, and
often the nature, of the thickening or encumbrance
which is present.</p>

<p>In our correspondent's case the thickening process
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg539" id="Pg539"></a>doubtless occurred as an after effect of the attack of
rheumatic fever.</p>

<p>The best remedy is suitable osteopathic treatment
for the spine, supplemented by <i>either very</i> hot or <i>quite</i>
cold spinal sitz baths, by acetic acid skin treatment,
or by any other means which will have the effect of disencumbering
the spine. By means of our treatment we
free the painful nerves from harmful pressure and promote
an increased blood circulation in the parts affected.
In this way the cause of the disorder is removed.</p>

<p>A diet along the following lines would be better than
the present one:&mdash;</p>

<p>8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Tumblerful of hot distilled water.</p>

<p>9.30.&mdash;One raw egg beaten up with cream and
vegetable juice or clear vegetable soup made without
salt. Wholemeal bread with plenty of butter and some
celery or watercress.</p>

<p>1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Two conservatively cooked vegetables
done without salt, with grated cheese as sauce and a
Granose biscuit with butter.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Tumblerful of hot distilled water only.</p>

<p>6.30.&mdash;2 oz. of cottage cheese or cream cheese, salad
and Granose biscuits, or &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; crackers, with butter.</p>

<p>9.30.&mdash;A raw egg beaten up with cream and vegetable
juice or soup.</p>

<p>I think dried milk preparations are inadvisable in such
cases as these (especially when taken as beverages, as
the &ldquo;milk sugars&rdquo; present are very prone to ferment
and to hinder the cleansing of the digestive tract), and
that the required proteid is best obtained from eggs and
curd cheese. Fat is very necessary in nervous troubles;
hence plenty of cream, fresh butter and cream cheese
should be taken; also pure oil with the salad.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Malt" id="Malt"></a>MALT EXTRACT.</h3>

an ordinary non-flesh diet, two teaspoonfuls or so at breakfast?
And is the desiccated or dry malt extract to be preferred to the
ordinary sticky article?</p></blockquote>

<p>Malt extract of good quality, containing an active
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg540" id="Pg540"></a>form of diastase, is a good form of relish to take with
meals. The diastase promotes starch digestion and
makes a good addition to foods of the cereal order. The
thick sticky form is the best because the diastase is
then in an active condition. Dried malt usually will have
this diastase destroyed, hence, although much more
convenient to handle, it is not so good dietetically as
the sticky original extract.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Sugar" id="Sugar"></a>ABOUT SUGAR.</h3>

<blockquote><p>C.T. writes.&mdash;I have read the article on sugar with considerable
interest. I have noted nervous disorders, etc., manifest in cases
of excessive consumption of manufactured sugar. I have been an
abstainer from cane sugar (all commercial sugars, though <i>I do
not know of any objection to milk, sugar</i>) for many years, regarding
it as an unnatural excitant and stimulant as well as being
inimical to digestion. As a physiologist I have taken immense
interest in longevity, feeling that an active life past the age of
ninety-five or a hundred, and upwards, carries with it, in evidence
of right living, the force of demonstration, and more conclusively,
in direct ratio to the advance of years. I firmly believe that all
anomalies will ultimately admit of resolution. In this connection
I could mention a number of strange and paradoxical cases for
which, as yet, I have obtained no solution. I know of
centenarians who began using &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; freely late in life. In one
case, when past eighty, a new set of teeth (not odd &ldquo;supernumeraries&rdquo;)
appeared all round! How is it, again, that the
natives of the West Indies, when living on sugar (in its crude state,
I suppose) have excellent teeth and perfect health? Is not raw
sugar better the less manufactured it is? On the other side,
Captain Diamond, at 114, attributes his health in great measure
to abstinence from sugar.</p></blockquote>

lactic, butyric and other destructive acids under the
influence of intestinal germs and thus do harm to the
body.</p>

<p>The natives of the West Indies (page 39) take the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg541" id="Pg541"></a>sugar cane in its natural state as a living vegetable
food&mdash;a very different thing from the isolated and
chemicalised sugar on our tables at home. Moreover,
the chewing required helps digestion. This is very
different to the drinking rapidly of sugared beverages,
which do not receive this necessary mouth preparation.</p>

<p>One is quite prepared to admit that paradoxical cases
do occur where sugar seems to agree well even with
octogenarians, but they are, in my opinion, the exceptions,
and I am constantly coming across cases where
the free consumption of table sugars has proved very
harmful to both old and young.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Stomach" id="Stomach"></a>ULCERATION OF THE STOMACH.</h3>

<blockquote><p>A.L.M. writes.&mdash;Our domestic servant, a girl aged twenty-four,
is suffering from ulceration of the stomach and has had periodical
attacks for the past six years. She has apparently, until she
came to us, eaten and drunk very unwisely. She has been with
us seven months and has been fed on a non-flesh diet since she
came. For the last four weeks tea, coffee and cocoa have been
forbidden, and as little sugar is consumed as possible. She had
a very bad attack in August and we had to call in a doctor is we
did not like the responsibility. He strongly recommended the
hospital and an operation, which would ensure that there would
be no repetition of the complaint. She decided to go and was there
six weeks. After much experimenting there, inoculating and
wondering whether it was tuberculosis, they operated and in due
course she came back. We went to the sea for three weeks and
shortly after our return the vomiting of blood and pains recommenced.
After four days in bed she returned to light dishes, and a
fortnight after another slighter attack came on, which
in twenty-four hours. She takes hot boiled water five times a
day. She suffers also from a horny skin on the palms of her
hands, with deep cracks where the natural lines are. These
periodically bleed. This skin exists also on her heels and the soles
of her feet. Before and after, an attack this skin seems to be worse
than ever.</p>

<p>I mentioned the fact of the recurring attacks since the operation
to the doctor and he seemed surprised and said the matter must
be constitutional and there was no hope for her.</p>

<p>My own opinion is that pure food will put her right eventually,
and that these attacks will recur in diminishing force until the
poisons are eliminated front the system.</p>

<p>Her diet is at present as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Half-pint of boiled water (hot).</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;Either Shredded Wheat softened in hot milk or
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg542" id="Pg542"></a>breakfast flakes and cold milk: followed by either bananas or
apples. Half-pint boiled water (hot).</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Ordinary vegetarian cooked dishes, vegetables conservatively
cooked, some fruit. Half-pint boiled water (hot).</p>

<p><i>Tea meal.</i>&mdash;Wholemeal bread (Artox flour), usually non-yeast,
nut butter. Lettuces and radishes when obtainable. Half-pint
boiled water (hot).</p>

<p><i>Before retiring.</i>&mdash;Half-pint of boiled water (hot).</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been shown by Brandl and other investigators
that ulceration of the stomach can always be produced
in animals by feeding them with an excess of sugar
foods. The same thing applies to human beings, who,
if fed with an excess of sweetmeats, sugar, milk or soft
mushy cereals, will first contract catarrh of the stomach,
which will ultimately deepen into a condition of ulceration.</p>

<p>The rationale of the process is this: Fermentation
and putrefaction of the foods eaten to excess produce
in the stomach various acids and toxins. These
become absorbed and pass into the liver. Then the
liver becomes clogged, its flow of blood is obstructed
and this naturally retards the flow of food from the
stomach. That organ becomes congested and inflamed
and, when the lower end, or pylorus, is obstructed, this
congested state may easily deepen into ulceration. We
also nearly always find a tender spine, showing that the
nervous system has equally participated in the conditions
produced, and this nervous factor intensifies the
trouble by retarding the due working of the digestive
functions.</p>

<p>What we have to do to cure a case of ulcerated
stomach is <i>to withhold the foods which create fermentation</i>.
Then the liver will be allowed time to work off
the poisons which are clogging its substance and when
this has come about the stomach will slowly return to
its normal condition.</p>

<p>The diet which our correspondent cites is badly
arranged. It is a mistake to give fluid <i>with</i> the meals,
and the mushy food at breakfast and the soft food at
dinner should be changed to drier and crisper forms of
nutriment.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg543" id="Pg543"></a>The following diet would be a distinct improvement:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Half-pint of boiled hot water, sipped
slowly; or quarter-pint Sanum Tonic Tea, taken hot.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;A Shredded Wheat biscuit <i>eaten dry</i> and
well buttered; a lightly boiled egg and some finely
grated raw roots, especially carrots and turnips.</p>

<p>In a case of this sort it is best not to mix cereals
with fruits.</p>

<p>An alternative breakfast would consist of <i>fruit alone</i>
such as two apples, finely grated at first, or two bananas
mashed and mixed with pure olive oil and sprinkled
with flaked nuts but care must be taken that the
pulped banana is well chewed.</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Grated cheese, or cream cheese, with some
finely chopped salad, or grated raw roots, or conservatively
cooked vegetables (preferably roots or onions
baked fairly dry by the casserole method) can be taken
at this repast. Follow with a slice or two of cold
ordinary toast or rusks with butter.</p>

<p><i>Tea meal.</i>&mdash;Half-pint of hot boiled water with a little
lemon or orange juice added to it for flavouring.</p>

<p><i>Supper</i> (about 6.30).&mdash;Stale standard bread with
butter and curd cheese or an egg. The non-yeast bread
should be avoided as in the weak state of the stomach
it will not be properly digested; besides, the bran may
irritate the lining in the present condition of the
stomach. As soon as the stomach has regained its
power of digesting food, and the ulcers have healed,
then fine wholemeal biscuits of the Wallace or Ixion
kind can be taken, but the unfermented bread had better
be avoided.</p>

<p><i>At bedtime.</i>&mdash;A half-pint of hot water.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Unfired" id="Unfired"></a>GOING TO EXTREMES IN THE UNFIRED DIET.</h3>

<blockquote><p>W.O.C. writes.&mdash;As a bachelor who (not believing in, and
therefore doing without domestic help) is anxious to reduce time
spent on cooking to a minimum, I shall be glad if Dr Knaggs will
tell me whether the use of the oven, pan and kettle are necessary
to healthy diet. For instance (1) would a diet of bread and butter,
biscuits, cheese, fruit (fresh and dried), ordinary cold water and
cold milk, be as healthy as a diet of hot vegetables, puddings,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg544" id="Pg544"></a>cocoashell, etc.? (2) Are cooked lentils, butter-beans, macaroni,
etc., more beneficial taken hot than after they have cooled? (3)
Could uncooked vegetables <i>of sufficient nutriment</i> be substituted for
these? I shall be glad if it is quite safe to live entirely on
raw foods, whether fresh or &ldquo;prepared.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the oven, pan and kettle is not essential
to a healthy diet, but few people in this changeable, and
often cold, depressing climate are willing to forgo their
occasional use. One cannot get hot water for a drink
without a kettle or a small saucepan and a gas ring,
and hot water is often a very comforting and useful
drink, especially where an effort is being made to break
off the tea and coffee habit.</p>

<p>A diet of bread and butter, biscuits, cheese, fresh and
dried fruits is excellent, provided our correspondent also
includes grated raw roots and salads as the medicinal
part of the regimen, and keeps the fresh fruit to itself
as one meal of the day. Cold water or cold milk could
also be taken in the place of hot water or hot milk,
although I deprecate the use of milk as a beverage unless
a person is willing to live entirely on milk like a baby
does. The hot vegetables are uncalled for, provided
the raw vegetables are substituted for them. The
puddings can well be discarded. Cocoashell beverages
are useful in very many cases.</p>

<p>Beans or lentils can be eaten sparingly in a raw state
if first soaked, then flaked in a Dana machine, and
afterwards flavoured with herbs or parsley. I certainly
think that, if they <i>are</i> to be cooked, the taste is better
if eaten hot; but there is no reason why cold cooked
lentils should not be eaten any more than is the case
with an other form of cooked food. Uncooked vegetables
will not take the place of lentils, because they
are of a different order of food-stuff. The uncooked
vegetable would go well with the lentils as neutralising
agents of the acids into which all nitrogenous foods
break down in the body. Most people will find that
nuts, cheese and eggs are better sources of proteid
than lentils or other &ldquo;pulse foods.&rdquo;</p>

humility, so there is an egotism that
apes selfishness, a cowardice that apes
stoicism and an indolence that apes
effort. This is especially apparent in
matters pertaining to health.</p>

<p>How often, on the plea of not causing worry or
expense to others, does a man or woman not put
off taking necessary rest, or consulting a doctor,
until a slight ailment that once would have yielded
to treatment becomes an irreparable injury.</p>

<p>Such conduct is often admired as unselfish, but
for unselfishness and stoicism a psychologist would
read fear, indolence and egotism. Fear of being
thought hypochondriacal and fear of facing facts;
shrinking from the exertion involved in the effort
to become healthy and from the pain involved in
witnessing the possible distress and anxiety of
friends should the complaint prove serious&mdash;regard<a class="pagenum" name="Pg546" id="Pg546"></a>less

to remedy his ignorance.</p>

<p>It is not fair, of course, to attach too much blame

<h2><a name="IMAGINATION_IN_INSURANCE" id="IMAGINATION_IN_INSURANCE"></a>IMAGINATION IN INSURANCE.</h2>


<p><i>Regular readers will recognise in this article a continuation of
the series previously entitled &ldquo;Healthy Brains.&rdquo; The author of
&ldquo;The Children All Day Long&rdquo; is an intimate disciple of one of
the greatest living psychologists, and she has a message of the
first importance to all who realise that true health depends as
much on poise of mind as on physical fitness.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcapiup" title="Transcriber's Note: This illuminated capital I is upside-down here as in the original."><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>t is an unpleasant subject, but have you
ever faced the fact that your widow might
be left in poverty?</p>

<p>We all know the phrases that come so
glibly from the lips of the insurance agent.
Perhaps the very fact that it pays companies
to spend thousands a year on the salaries of agents, and
other thousands on broadcast eye-catching advertisements,
shows that there are many things which our
imagination only accepts &ldquo;against the grain.&rdquo; Fire,
storm, loss by theft or burglary, sickness, disablement
and death we do not, by choice, dwell on these things
in thought.</p>

<p>Now some people are inclined to pet this impulse of
turning away. &ldquo;Do not think dark thoughts,&rdquo; they
tell us, &ldquo;the best insurance is unconsciousness, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'insousiance'.">insou<a class="pagenum" name="Pg547" id="Pg547"></a>ciance</ins>,
denial. Misfortune will pass you by if you do
not look for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps there is something to be said for this method
when it comes with absolute spontaneity from the innermost
nature. But if for the radiant apprehension of
beauty and health we substitute an effort to cling to the
picture of good when our very bodies and nerves are
warning us with suggestions of evil, we run grave risks.
By adopting someone else's sense of freedom from
danger and repressing our own conviction that for us
a certain danger, more or less remote, exists, we are
putting great pressure upon ourselves. At times of ill-health
or accidental worry, a sleepless night may bring
us an agonising succession of imaginative pictures,
those very pictures which we have attempted to banish
from our daily life. If we have still greater power of
repression these grim images, forbidden throughout
every moment of waking life, may reappear in dreams.</p>

<p>(Of the still more serious dangers of repression and
of its relation to various forms of insanity, this is hardly
the place to speak.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It ought not to be necessary to
appeal to alarming instances in order to make us attend
to a suggested warning.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11">[11]</a> See Bernard Hart's illuminating treatment of the whole subject
in <i>The Psychology of Insanity</i>, Cambridge Manuals of Science.</p>

<p>Now if we decide to regard all fear as a suggestion
of precaution, the emotional part of it to be laid aside
as soon as it has fulfilled its function of arousing interest
and directing action, it is easy to see the psychological
justification for insurance.</p>

<p>Of course pecuniary insurance is but one instance of
such sequences of action, though it happens to be a
rather obvious one. In a different field, most of us
know the delightful feeling of relief experienced after
consulting a doctor about some symptom that has perhaps
been troubling us for a long time. &ldquo;May I
safely do this? Ought I to refrain from that?&rdquo; and
such perpetually recurring irritations to the attention are
replaced by the knowledge that it is now the doctor's
business to decide whether this or that is &ldquo;serious,&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg548" id="Pg548"></a>and that as long as we carry out his orders we may lay
aside all worry about the matter.</p>

<p>So in the case of fire insurance, what we are really
buying with our annual premium is freedom from haunting
questions as to the loss that would ensue if our
house or shop or office were burnt down or damaged.
Whenever the thought comes, it may, as far as the
money loss is concerned, be dismissed.</p>

<p>We see then that instead of keeping the suggestion of
such misfortunes before us, as some people might allege,
the act of insurance substitutes for vague and recurrent
fears a formal and periodical recognition of possibilities,
a recognition, too, that contains within itself a precaution
against some of the results of the misfortune
should it ever occur. What we buy, at the cost of a
fixed number of pounds or shillings of money and a few
minutes of time once a year, is the right to put the
dangers out of our consciousness altogether and yet
leave no residuum of repressed fear to split up our
personality or give us indigestion.</p>

<p>If we choose, for some reason or other, to let our
imagination dwell on the objective side of the possibility
we have insured against, we shall find a pleasure in
thinking of what can be done by many people working
together. If we need help to meet some misfortune, it
is ours as a right, not doled out to us through others'
pity. And every year that we have made no claim we
have the delight of knowing that we are helping those
who need.</p>

<p>The art of working together is yet in its infancy.
But if even the present standard of method devised for
money insurance were to be adopted in the deeper
matters which we so often allow to trouble us, what an
advance in mental development we should have made
and what new possibilities of safe action would be
opened up!</p>

<h3 class="center">I</h3>

<p><span class="dropcapv"><span class="dropcap">V</span></span>egetarianism has been the object of
many attacks, and has also been warmly
defended. Most of its adepts have sought
to give the value of a dogma to its practice.</p>

<p>For quite a number of people &ldquo;vegetarianism&rdquo;
is a kind of religion, requiring of
its votaries a sort of baptism, and the sacrifice of many
pleasures. It is this which justifies the infatuation of
some, and the systematic disparagement of others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vegetalism&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> cannot pretend to play a similar
part, or to lend itself to ambiguity. To be a &ldquo;vegetalist&rdquo;
is to choose in the vegetable kingdom, with a
justified preference, foods susceptible of filling the
energy-producing needs, and the needs of the reparation
of the human system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vegetalism&rdquo; is a chapter of dietetic physiology
which must utilise the precise methods and recent discoveries
of the science of nutrition.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12">[12]</a> The word &ldquo;Vegetarianism&rdquo; implies a judgment of the qualities
which such a diet entails. This word is derived, in fact, from the
Latin adjective &ldquo;Vegetus&rdquo; (strong). The word &ldquo;Vegetalism,&rdquo;
which we oppose to the preceding one, admits only the establishing
of a fact, that of the choice&mdash;exclusive or preferred&mdash;of the
nutritious matters in the vegetable kingdom.</p>


<h3 class="center">II</h3>

<p>Before putting &ldquo;vegetalism&rdquo; into practice the first
point is to know whether the foods of &ldquo;vegetal&rdquo; origin
contain, and are susceptible of producing regularly, the
divers nutritive principles indispensable to the organisation
of an alimentary diet. The principles are the follow<a class="pagenum" name="Pg550" id="Pg550"></a>ing:&mdash;Proteid
or albuminoid substances; hydrocarbonated
and sweet substances fatty substances; mineral
matters, alkalis, lime, magnesia, phosphates and chlorides,
etc. In most compound foods, no matter of what
origin, mineral materials almost always exist in sufficient
quantities. The most important amongst them, at all
events, are found combined in liberal, even superabundant,
portions in dishes of vegetal origin. The
analysis of the ashes of our most common table vegetables
fixes us immediately to this subject: Leguminous
plants supply from about three to six per cent. of ashes,
rich in alkalis, lime and phosphates. Potatoes, green
vegetables and fruit as a whole absorbing considerable
quantities of mineral elements. These are the elements
of a nature to allow a precise reply to this question
which we propose to expound briefly.</p>


<h3 class="center">III</h3>

<p>In order to examine a food thoroughly, for the purpose
of ascertaining if it can be advantageously introduced
for consumption, whether albumins, fats, hydrate
of carbon, or sugar, etc., or again an association of
these principles in a composite article of food are in
question, divers researches must be carried out before
giving a final judgment.</p>

<p>If a more or less complex article of food is in question,
before considering it as a good nutriment, its centesimal
composition, or its immediate composition, should be
established; its theoretic calorific power should be
known, and it should be measured if this has not yet
been done.</p>

<p>Besides the calorific yield thus estimated <i>in vitro</i>, the
real utilisation in the human organism of articles of food
alone or mixed with other foods should be determined,
taking simultaneously into account their effects, whether
tonic, stimulating or depressing.</p>

<p>From a different point of view it is no longer allowable
to neglect before judging whether such and such
a nutritive substance is advantageous, the valuation of
what we have called, with Prof. Landouzy, the economic
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg551" id="Pg551"></a>yield&mdash;that is to say, the price of the energy, provided
by the unity of weight of the article of food.</p>

<p>It is only in reviewing &ldquo;vegetal&rdquo; substances, taking
these divers titles into consideration, that we shall be
justified in attributing to the practice of &ldquo;vegetalism,&rdquo;
integral or mitigated, its definite value.</p>


<h3 class="center">IV</h3>

<p>Only a few years ago, when Sch&uuml;tzenberger, emulator
and forerunner of Fischer, Armand Gautier, Kossel, first
disjointed the albuminoid molecule, to examine one by
one its divers parts, the composition of the various
albumins was very little known. Whether, therefore,
albumins of the blood, or those of meat or eggs, were in
question, these bodies were hardly ever separated,
except through physical circumstances, amongst others
by constant quantities of different coagulation. As to
the centesimal formula and the intimate structure of the
different protoid substances, they could be considered
as closely brought together.</p>

<p>From this fact, the physiological problem of the
utilisation of albumin was simpler. No matter which
article of food contained this albumin, its nutritive
power by unity of weight remained the same. At the
present time the number of albumins is no longer
limited. It is not now physical characteristics founded
difficult separations which arbitrarily distinguish those
bodies from each other. The individuality of each of the
albumins results from its formula of deterioration, under
the influence of digestive ferments, or of chemical bodies
acting in a similar way, as do mineral acids and alkalis.
For want of constituary formula this methodical
deterioration makes known the number of molecules
(acids or other bodies) which are responsible for the
structure of each albumin. These deleterious formula
of proteid matter are not less suggestive than composition
ones. They reveal notable differences between
&ldquo;vegetal&rdquo; and animal albumins.</p>

<p>To be sure, animal albumins (beef, veal, mutton,
pork, etc.) which we are offered in an alimentary flesh
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg552" id="Pg552"></a>diet, resemble more nearly the structure of our own
bodily albumins than do the gluten of bread or the
albumin of vegetables. This fact seems actually the
best support of the theory which affirms the superiority
of the flesh over the vegetable diet. Such a remark is
therefore well worth discussing by showing that the
consequences which can be deduced from it are paradoxical,
and rest upon hypothesis which, not very acceptable
in theory, are hardly verified in practice.</p>

<p>Admitting that albumin plays in alimentary diet only
the plastic part of reconstruction of used-up corporal
matter, it might be advantageous to ingest but one
albumin the composition of which is very similar to
our own. By virtue of the law of least effort such a
one in equal weights ought to be of more service than
a foreign albumin, as it requires less organic work.
For man, albumin of animal origin ought to be more
profitable in equal weight than vegetable albumin. In
the organism, indeed, albumin passes through a double
labour. After the intestinal deterioration, followed by a
passage through the digestive mucus membrane, a re-welding
of the liberated acids takes place, with a formation
of new albumin.</p>

<p>If, therefore, alimentary albumin's mission is, not to
be definitely burnt up in the organism, but to help in the
plastication of the individual, the more its initial formula
approaches the definite one to which it must attain, the
more profitable it becomes, giving out less useless fragments
and waste. Animal albumin approaching more
nearly to human albumin, is also the one whose introduction
into the daily alimentary diet is most rational.
This statement seems to be the defeat of vegetal albumin.
But let there be no mistake. It consecrates at
the same time the triumph of anthropophagy, for there
could not be for man a more profitable albumin than his
own, or that of his fellow-man! This should make us
pause and reflect, before allowing this deduction to be
accepted.</p>

<p>Besides, these arguments <i>ad hominem</i> do not
appear to us necessary for repelling such an interpreta<a class="pagenum" name="Pg553" id="Pg553"></a>tion
of facts. Modern works have shown us that the
greater proportion of ingested albumin played, in fact,
a calorific, and not a plastic, part. Under these conditions
one is justified in doubting whether there takes
place with regard to the total albumins ingested a work
of reconstruction thus complicated in the organism, after
their first deterioration. Evidently one may come to
believe that this complicated labour applies only to the
more or less feeble portion of albumin really integrated.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, the best criterion for judging
the utilisation of an ingested albumin lies in the persistence
of the corporal weight, allied to the ascertained
fact of a stable equilibrium in the total azotized balance-sheet
which is provided by the comparison of the
&ldquo;Ingesta&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Excreta.&rdquo; From this point of
view there exists the closest similitude between the
albumins of animal and those of vegetable origin; both,
in fact, are capable of assuring good health and corporal
and cellular equilibrium.</p>

<p>However, the digestibility of vegetable albumins
seems to remain slightly inferior to that of animal
albumins. 97 per cent. of the animal fibrine given in
a meal are digested, where 88 to 90 per cent. only of
vegetable albumins are absorbed and utilised. It is
a small difference, but not one to be overlooked. We
must say, however, that the method one employs in
determining these digestibilities takes from them a part
of their value, and renders difficult the comparison of
results obtained. Sensibly pure albumins are too often
compared in an artificial diet. One deviates thus from
the conditions of practical physiology. In fact, in ordinary
meals, all varieties of foods are mixed together,
acting and reacting upon each other, reciprocally modifying
their digestibility. If one conforms to this way of
acting towards alimentary albumins, the results change
sensibly. In the presence of an excess of starch, under
the shape of bread, for example, vegetable albumin
seems to be absorbed in about the same proportions as
animal albumin.</p>

<p>If, in a flesh diet, animal albumins are always con<a class="pagenum" name="Pg554" id="Pg554"></a>sumed
nearly pure (lean meat containing hardly anything
but albumin, besides a little fat, and an inferior
quantity of glycogen) vegetable albumin is always, on
the contrary, mixed with a number of other substances.
This is doubtless one of the reasons which causes the
digestibility of vegetable albumins to vary, the foreign
nutritive matters being able to bring about, under
certain circumstances, and in cases of superabundant
ingestions, a real albuminous &ldquo;saving&rdquo; in the newest
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Besides, a prejudicial question makes the debate
almost vain. When it was admitted by such physiologists
as Voit, Rubner and their school that from 140
to 150 grammes of albumin in the minimum were daily
necessaries in the human diet, a variation of a few units
in the digestive power presented some importance.
Nowadays the real utility of albumins is differently
appreciated. The need of them seems to have been
singularly exaggerated; first lowered to about 75 gr. by
A. Gautier, it has dropped successively with Lapicque,
Chittenden, Landergreen, Morchoisne and Labb&eacute;, by
virtue of considerations both ethnological and physiological,
to 50 grs., 30 grs. and even to 25 or 20
grammes. The &ldquo;nutritive relation&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the
yield from albuminoid matters to the total nutritive
matters of diet&mdash;is thus brought down from 1/3 its
primitive value to 1/15 or 1/20 at most. It follows
that the slight inferiority found in the digestive powers
of vegetable albumin appears unimportant. It is sufficient
to add 2 or 3 more grammes of albumin to a
ration already superabundant of from 40 to 50 grammes
of vegetable proteins to bring back a complete equilibrium
in the use of vegetable and animal varieties.
The theoretical inferiority of vegetable albumin thus
almost completely disappears.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg557" id="Pg557"></a><a name="WHAT_MAKES_A_HOLIDAY" id="WHAT_MAKES_A_HOLIDAY"></a>WHAT MAKES A HOLIDAY?</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>hat is it makes a holiday? Some people
want Paris, some Monte Carlo, one man
cannot be satisfied without big game to
hunt, another must have a grouse moor.
The student has his sailing boat, the young
wage-earner his bicycle, three girl friends
look forward to their week in a Hastings boarding-house.
Almost anything may be &ldquo;a change&rdquo;; most
things, to someone or other, are &ldquo;a holiday.&rdquo; What
does it all mean?</p>

<p>The sands of West Sussex are wide and free, firm
and smooth for walking with bare feet, lovely with
little shells and sea-worm curves and ripple marks and
the pits of razor-shells. Above them are the slopes of
shingle, gleaming with all colours in the September
sun. Farther up again, the low, brown crumbling
cliffs crowned with green wreaths of tamarisk. The
sea comes creeping up, or else the wind raises great
white breakers; if the waves are quiet, old breakwaters,
long ago broken themselves, smashed fragments here
and there of concrete protections put by man, gaps in
the cliff and changes in the coast-line, remind us of the
vast force behind the gentle and persistent lap of water.
The beach itself reminds us of it; there a flint and here
a rounded pebble made out of brick or glass, worn down
from man's rubbish to sea's proof of power.</p>

<p>Over it all are the children, brown-legged and bare-headed.
(Is it something in the weather this year that
has given us the particular red-brown, suggestive of
shrimp and lobster, that is the colour-vintage of 1913?)
Babies with oilskin waders, bathers, girls in vividly
coloured coats walking along the sands; all make up
the picture and give us once again the thrill of holiday.</p>

<p>Inland, the Sussex lanes are green and the trees are
broad and shady. Thatched cottages are everywhere,
and barns with heavy brows; yesterday I saw some pots
put for shelter from the sun under the far-projecting
thatch of a farmhouse. The gardens are full of sun-<a class="pagenum" name="Pg558" id="Pg558"></a>flowers
and hollyhocks, fuchsia and golden rod; the
walls are covered with jasmine and passion-flowers.
Old, old churches make us feel like day-flies. The yew
in the churchyard five minutes' walk from here is said
to be 900 years old; the church itself is thirteenth
century, but into its walls were built fragments of a
former church, far older, on the same site. It carries
us more than half-way back to the foundation of Christianity.
Dim tales of heathen earls and Norman kings
hang around the villages, and the very floor of the sea
beyond the land is richly laden with stores of half-forgotten
memories.</p>

<p>Which of all these things makes these days my holiday?</p>

<p>All of them, perhaps. Present moving life, and long-past
history, the mighty movement of nature and the
changes of geologic time: sheer beauty too and the
gaiety of amusements and excursions; do not all have
their place in unwinding us from the tight coils we make
for our working days?</p>

<p>Freedom to take from the world whatever is there of
beauty and of interest&mdash;it really hardly matters what
or where; freedom enhanced by sympathy, perhaps, for
we seem to need some comrade in our play; so many
days and nights following each other&mdash;no matter exactly
how many&mdash;for letting ourselves go, and letting the
world and all its power and wonder flow into us; that,
whatever be place, time and conditions, is the making
of a holiday.</p>

<h4><i>A New Definition of Neurasthenia.</i></h4>

<p>We cull the following definition of neurasthenia from
our French contemporary: Neurasthenia is discouragement
of the soul. Being in a state of discouragement
the soul ceases to take care of the body and allows it
to become encumbered with waste products. The body
in its turn becomes so defective that the soul is incapable
of repairing the enfeebled organs and throws
the body away into the water or leaves it somewhere to
be crushed or abandons it by some other means.
Neurasthenia may be compared to an indolent mechanic.
He neglects to oil his engine. It runs off the rails and
is smashed.</p>


<h4><i>Fresh Departures.</i></h4>

<p>The Vegetarian Society of France has introduced
three new sections into its organisation. The first is
documentary, and aims at the collection, centralisation
and classification of all information bearing on food
reform. The second deals with domestic economy and
hygiene. A number of ladies willing to devote themselves
to the popularisation of the leading ideas of
vegetarianism have joined this section. They offer
advice and instruction to all who wish to familiarise
themselves with food reform principles. The third
section is concerned with physical training and outdoor
games, with special reference to the relationship between
these things and a non-flesh regimen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Vegetarische Warte.&rdquo;</span></h3>

<h4><i>Nietzsche as Fruitarian.</i></h4>

<p>&ldquo;A simple life,&rdquo; wrote Nietzsche in 1879, &ldquo;is very
difficult at the present time,&rdquo; and went on to explain
its difficulties and to suggest that even the most determined
would be obliged to leave the discovery of the
way to a wiser generation. He himself, however, took
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg560" id="Pg560"></a>some steps upon the way during his stay in Genoa,
when he lived on bread and fruit and spent but a few
shillings a week. Eggs were occasionally included, and
artichokes&mdash;and the little cookery he needed was done
by himself over a spirit lamp. His winter in Genoa,
he declares, was the happiest in his life and saw the
production of his &ldquo;Twilight of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>


<h4><i>Food Reform in Russia.</i></h4>

<p>The movement goes ahead rapidly in Russia. Hardly
a town of any size but has now its vegetarian restaurant.
This year the first Russian Vegetarian Congress has
been held. It seems to have been a very successful
gathering. &ldquo;Seldom,&rdquo; writes one who was present,
&ldquo;have I experienced such a strong impression as was
made upon me by this first vegetarian congress in
Moscow.&rdquo; Unity seems to have been the prevailing
note. Papers were read on the general significance and
the various aspects of vegetarianism, followed by discussions.
Amongst the various excursions undertaken
was a pilgrimage to Yasnaya Polyana, including a visit
to Tolstoy's grave.</p>

<p>A Vegetarian Exhibition has also been held in
Moscow. It included a fine show of fruits and vegetables,
exhibits of various substitutes for leather, soaps
made of vegetable oils, an abundance of Russian and
foreign vegetarian literature of all sorts, from the
noblest reaches of theory to the most invaluable details
of practice. The next Congress is arranged for Easter
1914, at Kiev.</p>


<h4><i>A Hopeful Sign.</i></h4>

<p>Fifteen years ago the Berlin municipal authorities
stoutly refused Professor Baron's offer to found an
orphanage which should be conducted on vegetarian
principles. At the present moment it is being arranged
that all school children shall be taught the value of
vegetables and leguminous preparations and the wholesomeness
of a diet that is relatively non-stimulating
and practically meatless.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg561" id="Pg561"></a><a name="THE_CURTAINED_DOORWAYS" id="THE_CURTAINED_DOORWAYS"></a>THE CURTAINED DOORWAYS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>n George Macdonald's <i>Phantastes: a Faery
Romance for Men and Women</i> it is told
how a man found himself in the midst of a
great circular hall built entirely of black
marble. On every side and at regular
intervals there were archways, all heavily
curtained. Hearing a faint sound of music proceeding
from one of these hidden doorways he went towards it
and, drawing aside the hangings, found a large room
crowded with statuary, but no sign of an living
creature. Yet he was certain the music had proceeded
from that particular archway. Greatly puzzled, he let
the curtain fall and stepped back a few paces. At once
the music continued. Stepping stealthily and quickly to
the curtain, he again lifted it, and received a vivid
impression of a crowd of dancing forms suddenly
arrested: something told him beyond dispute that at
the moment he had drawn the hangings aside what
were now lovely but motionless statues had sprung
each to its pedestal out of the mazes of an intricate
dance. Sound and movement had been frozen, in a
flash of time, into a crowd of beautiful forms&mdash;in stone.
No statue but seemed to tremble into immobility as the
intruder's gaze turned this way and that no marble
face but seemed to be aglow with the music that had
died with his entry; no white limb but seemed to be
tremulous with the rhythm of the dance that had
ceased so suddenly.</p>

<p>If the subtlety and imaginative truth of this story
should lead you to read the whole book, I shall have
had the privilege of introducing you to what is surely
one of the finest and most delicately wrought fantasies
in the English language, a fantasy so permeated with
beauty and truth that you will neither wish nor need
to look for the &ldquo;moral&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But whether you read <i>Phantastes</i> or not, I may
be allowed to suggest that the incident I have at<a class="pagenum" name="Pg562" id="Pg562"></a>tempted
to describe conveys one of the secrets of
healthy living.</p>

<p>It is a trite saying, that health is harmony. But I
plead for a much wider and fuller interpretation of
harmony than is customary. <i>Mens sana in corpore
sano</i>&mdash;a sane mind in a healthy body&mdash;does not fill all
the requirements of a healthy life. It is but an excellent
theme, wanting orchestration.</p>

<p>It is good to aim at a harmonious working of one's
internal arrangements if one has had the misfortune
or the folly to break that harmony. The physical
basis of life must be attended to if we would be well.
Only, you cannot stop there without imperilling the
whole scheme.</p>

<p>Again, it is good to train the body by means of
exercise, play, singing and handicraft; all these things
react both upwards and downwards, outwards and
inwards. For example, one of the special virtues of
tennis, if it be played at all keenly, is the necessity for
making one's feet (those neglected members!) quick
and responsive to the messages of eye and brain. In
an increasingly sedentary age the rapidly growing
popularity of tennis is, for this one reason alone, a
good omen. But if you play tennis, or any other
healthy outdoor sport, or learn how to sing, or how to
breathe, or if you do M&uuml;ller's exercises daily, for the
sole purpose of benefiting your liver or developing
your muscles, or of &ldquo;keeping fit,&rdquo; you will miss the
real prize.</p>

<p>It is good, also, to train the mind to be logical,
critical and balanced: it is good to cultivate a retentive
memory and to store up useful facts. But if while you
are aiming at intellectual fitness and alertness you
allow these good things to obscure other and better
things, if, in short, you let means become ends, you
will never be healthy, because you will miss half the
joys of living.</p>

<p>There are many very skilful performers on musical
instruments. They have set themselves, or their
parents have set them, to gain certain prizes, distinc<a class="pagenum" name="Pg563" id="Pg563"></a>tions
or qualifications. No music is now too difficult
for them to execute. But that is exactly what they do&mdash;they
execute it: destroy its head and heart by sheer
mechanical perfection. They have mastered the piano,
or the organ, or the violin, or their own voice; but
music eludes them.</p>

<p>You see why I began with that tale of the curtained
doors, the mysterious music, and the quivering statuary.
There is an elusive, haunting quality about life and
all living things which, if we look for it and listen to
it, imparts a glamour, a rhythm, a beauty to everything
that is worth doing. The great danger is that
in the pressure of work, the hurry of play, the pursuit
of health, or the training of the mind we miss the very
thing which can give meaning and value to all these
things. The severely matter-of-fact people don't
go near the curtained doors, and if they did, would
discover only a lot of cold, lifeless statues. Whoever
heard of statues dancing? Whoever heard of music
without instruments? And yet this very sense of a
lyrical movement imperfectly seen, and of a temporarily
frozen music, is not only the very secret of all art: it
is a slender guiding clue to the centre of everything....</p>

<p>And in the house of every man, and of every woman,
are the curtained doorways.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT4" id="HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT4"></a>HOW MUCH SHOULD WE EAT?</h2>


<p><i>This discussion arose out of the <a href="#HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT1">article</a> with above
title, by &ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; which was published in our <a href="#Pg437">July
number</a>.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>


<h3 class="center">III</h3>

<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> lift my hat to M.D. and trust that, as
I don't know him, the somewhat jarring
difference that I have with his views will
not be put down to personal feeling. A.A.
Voysey has put my first objection quite well
from the layman's point of view. He says
&ldquo;there is no agreement between those who have been
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg564" id="Pg564"></a>taught physiology.&rdquo; This is true. Playfair's full diet
is different from Voit's. Voit's is different from
Atwater's. Atwater's is different from Chittenden's.</p>

<p>The custom of reducing the diets to calories, inasmuch
as it introduces a false theory, has had a disastrous
effect on progress, and has been a great hindrance to
the attainment of knowledge. If the coal in the fireplace
<i>were</i> the cause of the heat of the fire (but is it?),
there is no analogy between the elevation of the heat by
hundreds and even thousands of degrees when the fire
is lighted, and the elevation of half-a-degree or a degree
which occurs when food is taken into the body, especially
when we remember that a similar elevation of temperature
occurs when work is performed by means of the
body without eating or drinking at all.</p>

<p>It is quite evident to every clear seer, or it ought to
be, that the force of animal life or zoo-dynamic is the
cause of the heat of the body, just as the electric force
is the cause of the liberation of heat through the battery,
and the chemic force is the cause of the heat of the
fire, and that zoo-dynamic and electro-dynamic and
chemico-dynamic are forms or species or varieties of
the one omnipotent and eternal energy by which all
things in this universe consist. The aggregate of all
the particular forces makes up the eternal energy which
is one. They are all species of the one, but it is convenient
and even necessary for our limited intellects to
consider them separately, for the indefinite number of
the facts and also their intricacy and complexity stagger
and overwhelm us unless we do; and indeed they stagger
us even when we try to treat them and take them up
separately for consideration and examination. But now
for the proof of A.A. Voysey's statement.</p>

<p>Ranke found he required 100 grammes proteid; fat
100 grammes; carbo-hydrate 240 grammes to keep him
going. These he could have got from 9 oz. of lean
meat or 250 grammes, 18 oz. of bread or 500 grammes,
12 oz. or 55 grammes of butter and 1 oz of fat (I do not,
of course, suggest that it would have been wise for him
to get them so). Moleschott's demands are: proteid
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg565" id="Pg565"></a>120 grammes, fat 90 grammes, carbo-hydrate 333
grammes. Voit demands for hard work: proteid 145
grammes, fat 100 grammes, carbo-hydrate 450 grammes.
Atwater demands for hard work the following:&mdash;proteid
177 grammes, fat 250 grammes, carbo-hydrate 650
grammes. Horace Fletcher, we are told by Professor
Chittenden, took for a time, when everything was
accurately measured and weighed: proteid 44.9
grammes, fat 38 grammes, carbo-hydrate 253 grammes.
Cornaro lived on 12 oz. of solid food and 14 oz. of red
wine a day for a period of something like 60 years,
from 38 years of age to about 97, and had vigorous
health during the time except when he transgressed
his rule. Of course, he was not a hard physical worker&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
he did not do the work of a navvy. But how,
in view of these differences, can M.D. say: &ldquo;These
quantities were settled by physiologists many years ago,
and no good reasons have since been adduced for
altering them&rdquo;? It is amazing to me to read such a
statement. It reminds me of a statement by a distinguished
physician in London during last year to the
effect that we could not give a growing schoolboy too
much food&mdash;we could not over-feed him. My opinion,
on the other hand, after a long experience, during which
time my eyes have not been shut, is that the large
majority of the diseases of humanity are due to mal-nutrition
and that the form of that mal-nutrition is
over-feeding&mdash;not under-feeding. This opinion should
be taken for what it is worth. But to test it we should
ask ourselves: What is the reason for the necessity to
take food into the body? Is it to give strength and
heat to the body? Or is it to restore the waste of the
body sustained by the action on it of the force of life or
zoo-dynamic which inhabits it? The demands for food
will vary and vary much according to the way in which
we answer this question. As you allowed me to discuss
this question in <i>Healthy Life</i> in July and August of last
year I must not take up your space by discussing it
again. But the answer we give determines the amounts
of food that we require to take, since, obviously, if the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg566" id="Pg566"></a>strength and heat of the body depend upon the food,
the more food we take the more strength and heat shall
we have; while, if the function of food in the adult or
grown body is only to restore the waste of the body, the
question is how much is the waste. There are various
ways in which this question can be answered and I
cannot go into them now; but I say, in my opinion, the
waste is very much less than is commonly supposed.
The body, I take it, is made by zoo-dynamic or the
life-force to be a fit habitation for itself. The body
must waste when the life-force acts through it, and that
waste must be restored by food and sleep, or the body
will die; since things (the body) cannot act as the
medium of conveying forces (zoo-dynamic or the life-force)
without wasting under their action. But so beautifully
has the body been made by zoo-dynamic that it
wastes very little, much less than is commonly supposed,
by the action of zoo-dynamic through it. Not seeing
this, we ingest into the body far more than is required
to restore its waste, and so we fall ill, for, obviously,
if we ingest more than the quantity necessary for this
purpose we choke the body up and render it inefficient
for its purpose as an instrument for work.</p>

<p>Now this is precisely what seems to me to happen
in life. As we are all under the double delusion that the
strength of the body and its heat come from the food,
we all with one accord put far too much food into the
body, and when we find that we die, all of us, generation
after generation, at from 50 to 70 years of age, we make
up little proverbs to justify our unphysiological conduct
and say that three score years and ten are the measure
of the duration of life. M.D. says that &ldquo;some twenty
years ago most people lived fairly close to the old
physiological quantities&rdquo; (but what are these? for we
have seen how they vary), &ldquo;now they have been cut
adrift from these and are floundering out of their
depth.&rdquo; May I remind M.D. that people are now living
longer than they did twenty years ago. How does he
account for that? No doubt some of the increase in
the length of life is due to the diminution of the birth
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg567" id="Pg567"></a>rate, but still I suppose M.D. would admit that there
is an increase in the duration of life over and above
what can be accounted for in this way. If so, how
does he account for it?</p>

<p>M.D. says, further: &ldquo;For the public it will now
probably suffice if they insist on raising (or considering,
A.R.) the question of quantity&rdquo; (of
food, A.R.) &ldquo;wherever they suffer in any way.&rdquo;
I agree with all my heart. But M.D. implies, if I
read him aright, that the public should increase
the quantity of their food when they suffer in any
way. I, on the other hand, and rather unhappily for
myself, am convinced that the raising of this question
implies that it should be answered in the exact opposite
way to that of M.D. and that we should diminish our
food if we &ldquo;suffer in any way.&rdquo; And I can point to
Nature's own plan as a corroboration of the truth of
my view, for her plan when we suffer in any way is to
fling us into bed and take away our appetite, or at least
to diminish our appetite if we are not so ill as to require
to remain in bed.</p>

<p>The whole question of medical practice depends on
the answer we give to this question, and therefore one
might go on indefinitely with its discussion. Neither
the Editors' space and patience nor my time allow of
this; but I should like to ask M.D., with all respect, if
he remembers what Dr King Chambers said of the starvation
that comes of over-repletion? Dr King
Chambers occupied one of the most prominent places
as a consultant in London (very probably, I suppose)
when M.D. was a very young man. My late lamented
friend, Dr Dewey of Meadville, Pennsylvania, used
the phrase &ldquo;starvation from over-feeding,&rdquo; not
knowing that Dr King Chambers had used practically
the same expression before him. That I made the
same discovery myself, and independently, is not, I
take it, a sign of acuteness of intellect or of observation.
The amazing thing is that every practitioner is not
compelled to make the same discovery. But if it is a
true discovery, then it follows that all the signs of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg568" id="Pg568"></a>lowered vitality referred to by M.D., while they <i>may</i> be
caused by under-feeding, may also be caused by over-feeding
and may therefore require for proper treatment,
not increase of the diet, but diminution of it. A low
temperature, therefore, a slow pulse, languor, pallor,
inanition, fatigue, good-for-nothingness, inefficiency,
anorexia, an&aelig;mia, neurasthenia, etc., etc., may all be
due to blocking of the body with too much food as well
as to supplying it with too little. Fires may be put out
by heaping up too much coal on them. To make them
burn briskly we ought to push the poker in and gently
lift the coal so as to admit of the entrance of air. Then
in a while our fire will become brisk and bright. And
so it may be in the body. Nay, my opinion is that
almost always these marks of depression are caused by
blocking up of the body and that therefore the proper
treatment is, as a rule, not increase but diminution of
the diet. The place in the body in which the blocking
first occurs is the connective tissues or the tissues that
connect every part with every other. It is here that
the lymph is secreted, and as the lymph joins the
thoracic duct which conveys the products of digestion
to the blood, it is obvious that lymph-secretion is a
complementary digestive process and it is also obvious
how blocking up of the connective tissues, which is the
immediate cause of anorexia and inanition, usually
comes to exist in the body.</p>

<p>M.D. talks of &ldquo;natural food.&rdquo; He seems to be a
vegetarian? Good. But is not the question of how
much food we ought to eat equally urgent whether we
are vegetarian or omnivorous? I think it is. I do not
think that the chief cause of our illnesses to-day is
taking wrong or unsuitable food. In my opinion we
are ill mainly because we take suitable food too often
and because we take too much of it. My answer to the
question, therefore&mdash;&ldquo;How Much Should We Eat?&mdash;A
Warning&rdquo;&mdash;turns on the previous question:
What is the Function performed by Food in
the Body? As I think that this function in
the grown body is only to restore the waste, the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg569" id="Pg569"></a>warning in my mind is far rather that we should take
less than that we should (as M.D. advises us) take
more. I agree with him in the view that &ldquo;chronic
starvation is insidious.&rdquo; But, as I believe that &ldquo;chronic
starvation&rdquo; is usually a form of Dr King Chambers's
&ldquo;starvation from over-repletion&rdquo; and of Dr Dewey's
&ldquo;starvation from over-feeding,&rdquo; I am bound to be of
the consequent opinion that it is to be met, not by
increase, but by diminution of the diet. This is one of
my reasons for thinking that none of us ought ever to
eat oftener than twice a day, under fifty years of age,
and that after that we would do well to eat once a day
only. I feel sure that if we altered our habits in these
ways, we should add very much both to the duration
and to the efficiency of life. This is not a question of
dietetics only. The issue is of the most practical character.
What an addition of five or ten or fifteen or twenty or
twenty-five years to the average duration of life might
mean to this people and still more to the people of the
whole globe is unpredictable by mortal man. But it is
evident that it would be of the very greatest import to
humanity. This is the great issue of the discussion
of this subject. It seems to me that illness might be
enormously diminished and health and efficiency and
happiness immensely increased. But I think that these
boons might be obtained, not by indulging the body
and its appetites, but only by the exercise of a wise
restraint and government over it. It is at least very
much to be desired that more agreement might be
manifested in the opinions and practice of qualified
physiologists so that the public might have clear guidance,
and not as at present, be advised in ways so
conflicting that they do not know what or whom to
believe.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg571" id="Pg571"></a><a name="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES2" id="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES2"></a>HEALTHY LIFE RECIPES.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">More Egg Dishes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="firstletter">I</span>n our issue of May 1912 we published a number of
special recipes for eggs. These were much appreciated.
And even now this and other back numbers
are asked for. We now give some further recipes.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that eggs are a simple
form of animal food and much purer than meat.
They are also easily digested by most people. They
therefore form a very useful substitute for flesh-foods,
especially where the latter have only recently been
discarded.</p>

<p>The normal progress towards a more or less ideal
diet involves, of course, the elimination of eggs as well
as of other dairy products. But wise food reform
proceeds always by steps.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savoury Baked Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Melt a little butter, or vegetable fat, in an open
earthenware baking dish; break into this as many eggs
as required. Cover thinly with grated cheese; add a
knob of butter and bake till set. The dish can be
placed direct on the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg on Tomato.</span><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>One egg, two medium-sized tomatoes, butter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Skin the tomatoes; cut in halves and put them, with
a small piece of butter, into a small stewpan. Close
lightly, and cook slowly until reduced to a pulp. Break
the egg into a cup, and slide it gently on to the
tomato. Replace the pan lid and the egg will poach in
the steam rising from the tomato.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13">[13]</a> This recipe is from <i>The Healthy Life Cook Book</i>, a new and
revised edition of which is in contemplation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savoury Egg Fritters.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>Six eggs, two large tomatoes, half-teaspoon mixed dried herbs,
about three tablespoons ground biscuits (&ldquo;Ixion&rdquo; or any of the
unsweetened &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; kinds).</p></blockquote>

<p>Hard boil three of the eggs and chop them finely.
Skin the tomatoes, mash them and add to the chopped
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg572" id="Pg572"></a>eggs with the remaining eggs (well beaten), herbs and
biscuit powder. Should the mixture be too moist to
mould add more biscuit powder; if too dry add a little
water. Cut and shape into finger shapes and either
fry in olive oil or bake on buttered tin or open earthenware
baking dish. (The last-mentioned is the best
method, as the baking dish can be brought to the
table as it is, and there is only one dish instead of two
to wash up afterwards.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savoury Egg Patties.</span></h3>

<p>The above Egg Fritter mixture made rather moist
may be used as a filling for savoury patties.</p>

<p>Make for these a short crust with &frac12; lb. of Artox meal,
3 oz. of Nutter and water. Slightly bake the shells of
pastry (made thin) before adding the filling, and finish
to a golden brown.</p>

<p>Serve these and the fritters with either brown gravy
or white sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Egg Souffl&eacute;.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>Five eggs, &frac34; lb. soft cane sugar, 1 oz. ground rice, 2 oz. of
butter, rind of half a lemon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs. Beat up
the yolks and sift in the ground rice, sugar and grated
rind of the lemon. To this batter add the well-whisked
whites. Well heat the butter in a frying pan, turn in
the batter and fry over gentle heat till set. Fold over
the edges and place on well-greased flat dish and bake
for barely a quarter of an hour. Sift over some soft
cane sugar and serve very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snow Eggs.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>Three eggs, one and a quarter pints of milk, a teaspoon of
soft cane sugar, vanilla flavouring.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs
and whisk the whites to a very stiff froth
with the sugar. Put the milk into a saucepan and
when it boils drop in whites of eggs in small pieces
shaped between two dessert spoons. Only a little should
be cooked at a time in this way, and each should be
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg573" id="Pg573"></a>allowed to poach for two minutes, and when done
should be taken out with a slice and put on a sieve to
drain. When all the whites are used in this way, strain
the milk and add it to the well-beaten yolks. Pour into
a double saucepan and stir over the fire till the custard
thickens; flavour with vanilla to taste.</p>

<p>When <i>cold</i> pour into a dish and lay the snow eggs
on top.</p>

<p>(Kindly supplied by Mrs Edith Wilkinson.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg-raised Cherry Cake.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>9 oz. good &ldquo;standard&rdquo; flour, 5 oz. Nutter (or other nut fat),
5 oz. cane castor sugar, 2 oz. preserved cherries (glac&eacute;), 2 oz.
well-washed sultanas, 2 oz. ground almonds, four eggs, outer rind of
lemon (grated).</p></blockquote>

<p>Beat Nutter and sugar to a cream; add eggs one by
one, beating all the time; have ready the flour, with the
fruit, grated lemon rind and ground almonds mixed in,
and add gradually to the above mixture, beating all the
time, and until of even consistency throughout. Line
a cake tin with double thickness of buttered paper, pour
in the mixture and bake in moderate oven about one and
a half hours.</p>

<p><i>Any housewife who doubts the possibility of making
light and dainty cakes without the now customary
baking powder and baking soda, etc., should try the
above recipe. No one could wish for a more excellent
cake.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Note On Casseroles.</span></h3>

<p>Now that casserole cookery (<i>i.e.</i> cooking in earthenware
dishes, both open and covered) is becoming more
widely known and practised, readers will be glad to
know that many housewives believe in boiling new
earthenware before using it, as this effectually toughens
and hardens it. This is particularly efficacious in the
case of ordinary brown kitchenware, the articles being
placed in a large pan of cold water which is then
brought slowly to the boil. After being allowed to boil
for ten minutes remove the pan and allow the water to
cool before taking out the ware.</p>

<blockquote><p>Miss R.E.N. writes.&mdash;I am troubled with excessive perspiration.
I neither eat meat nor drink tea. I have a cold sponge bath
down to my waist every morning, and I change all my clothes
when I go to bed. My diet is, roughly, as follows:</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;Oatmeal porridge with toast or bread and jam or

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Peas, beans or lentils, eggs, cheese. Vegetables:

<p><i>Tea meal.</i>&mdash;Wholemeal bread and butter, nuts, jam, cake,
pastry; hot water.</p>

<p><i>At bedtime.</i>&mdash;Hot water or coffee.</p></blockquote>

<p>If our correspondent wishes to remedy this excessive
perspiration she must get a hot towel-bath daily (all
over),<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> wearing porous linen-mesh underclothing next
the skin. She should also discontinue the soft sugary
and starchy foods, and not mix fruit with other foods
(it is best taken by itself, say, for breakfast). She needs
more of the cooling salad vegetables. The following
diet would be a great improvement:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Half-pint of hot boiled water, sipped

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;Wholemeal bread or biscuits and butter

Stop porridge, jam and golden syrup. Avoid drinking
at meals.</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Two eggs, or 2 oz. of curd cheese. Two
vegetables cooked in casserole without salt; wholemeal
bread or biscuits and butter; a few figs, prunes, dried
bananas, or raisins, washed but not cooked. Avoid
milk puddings or stewed fruits as too fermentative and
heating.</p>

<p><i>Supper meal.</i>&mdash;1 to 2 oz. flaked nuts, some crisp
&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ixion&rdquo; biscuits with nut butter. Some
fresh salad or grated roots. Stop jam, cake and
pastry.</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Ulcerated" id="Ulcerated"></a>DIET FOR ULCERATED THROAT.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs L.B. writes.&mdash;Do you think it would be wise for a person
suffering from ulcers in the throat and on other mucous membranes
to adopt a diet devoid of meat, yeast and salt?</p></blockquote>

<p>It would certainly be wise to discard meat and salt
in a case of this kind, but yeast is sometimes useful
taken as &ldquo;unflavoured Marmite.&rdquo; The chief cause
of ulcers is the abuse of the soft cereal and sugary
foods. In a case of this sort I should advise a diet
consisting exclusively of well-dextrinised cereals&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
Granose, Melarvi, etc.&mdash;with plenty of grated raw roots
and finely chopped salads and tomatoes. This can be
combined with curd cheese, raw or lightly cooked eggs,
flaked nuts or Brusson Jeune bread as the proteid part
of the diet.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Farming" id="Farming"></a>FARMING AND SCIATICA.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs A.C.B. writes.&mdash;For two months my husband, who leads an
active open-air life, has had severe pain all down the back of his
left leg. It is like neuralgia, and comes on worse when sitting.
He has been a farmer all his life, but is anything but strong and
constantly taking cold. Are these pains likely to be due to wrong
food?</p></blockquote>

<p>This pain is evidence of sciatica. Chills alone will
not produce sciatica, which has its real cause in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg576" id="Pg576"></a>system being choked up with acids and toxins of various
kinds. In such a case as this, warm water enemas
should be taken freely to clear the colon well; sugar,
milk and all starchy mushy foods should be strictly
avoided; vegetables should be taken either as baked
roots or as fresh salads; eggs and cheese should be
substituted for meat; and plenty of fresh butter should
be taken. Boiled water, <i>between meals</i>, will be good,
but nothing should be given to drink with food. Salt,
pickles, and greasy or highly flavoured foods should be
avoided.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Brights" id="Brights"></a>TEMPORARY &ldquo;BRIGHT'S DISEASE&rdquo; AND HOW
TO DEAL WITH IT.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Miss E. would like to know what kind of diet is suitable for one
who has been suffering from Bright's Disease following a serious
illness. Why should meat have any bad effect upon the kidneys?
She does not take it, although her medical man advises the use of
it at once.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not an uncommon thing for people who have
suffered from an acute septic fever to find albumen
temporarily present in the urine. This is due to the
irritant action of the toxins and other poisons (which
the fever is the means of ejecting) upon the structure of
the kidneys. The kidneys are filters and they remove
the bulk of the soluble waste of the body.</p>

<p>The practitioner frequently finds albumenuria in cases
of scarlet fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria, etc., and the
object of his treatment is to prevent this condition of
kidney irritation from becoming an established disease
(Bright's disease).</p>

<p>Flesh foods, and especially meat extracts and meat
soups, are the worst possible wherewith to feed these
fever cases, because they throw so much extra work
upon the kidneys. Meat is composed mainly of proteids.
It also contains the urinary wastes and the toxins (due
to fear) which were in the animal's body and on the
way to elimination when it was killed.</p>

<p>This sufferer should take one meal per day consisting
of fresh fruit only; the rest of the diet should consist
of salad vegetables and finely grated raw roots, home-<a class="pagenum" name="Pg577" id="Pg577"></a>made
curd cheese, dextrinised cereals (such as Melarvi
biscuits, Shredded Wheat, &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; crackers, Granose
biscuits, Grape-Nuts, twice-baked standard bread, etc.)
and fresh or nut butter.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Phosphorus" id="Phosphorus"></a>PHOSPHORUS AND THE NERVES.</h3>

<blockquote><p>W.H.H. writes:&mdash;I should be very grateful if Dr Knaggs could
help me with any information or hints regarding phosphaturia.
I suffer much from this troublesome complaint.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have to remember that the nervous system is two-fold.
The one, or conscious portion, consists of the
brain and spinal cord, from which all the nerves or
branches travel to all parts of the body and give us
dominion over them. The other, or subconscious, called
the sympathetic nervous system, lies on either side of
the front of the spine as two long chains with centres,
or ganglia, at intervals. This second system is not
within our control and has to do with the regulation of
our vegetative functions, including the bulk of the
digestive process.</p>

<p>All nerves, whether they come from the brain or from
the sympathetic system, ranging to their smallest terminals,
are built alike of cells, and these cells secrete
a complex <i>fatty</i> substance, called <i>lecithin</i>, whose
dominant element is phosphorus. This phosphorus has
to be supplied to the body with food, and as food, and
it cannot be properly utilised or assimilated by the body
or used by the nerves to build up their <i>lecithin</i> unless
it is eaten in the form of organic compounds.</p>

<p>The tissues of the body are continually dying, as a
result of work done, and are continually being replaced
by fresh young tissues as needed. It is the function
of the nerves to manage this work for us as well as to
similarly arrange for reproduction.</p>

<p>In order to control the functions of the various organs
and tissues and to regulate the rate at which they
reproduce themselves, the nerves extend their terminal
branches, not only into every tissue, but into every
microscopical unit of such tissue, and the part of the
cell which represents the nerve terminal is the inner
structure called the nucleus.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg578" id="Pg578"></a>Now it will be obvious that the more the two nervous
systems are worked the greater will be their depletion
of <i>lecithin</i> and the more need there will be for fresh
supplies of phosphorus in the daily food rations.</p>

<p>The person who works hard, whether it be manual
labour or brain work, needs food and rest at intervals
in order that the nerves may recuperate and replenish
their stocks of <i>lecithin</i>.</p>

<p>A goodly proportion of uncooked foods rich in phosphorus
must be supplied to make good the wear and
tear, and the digestion must equally be efficient if these
food-stuffs are to become assimilated.</p>

<p>Cooking of food to a large extent breaks down the
organic phosphorus salts and makes them inorganic.
In this state they are of but little use to the body. Poor
digestion associated with putrefactive fermentation
equally converts the organic salts into inorganic ones.
These pass into the blood and are promptly eliminated
by the kidneys as waste (<i>phosphaturia</i>) and thus they
never reach the nerves at all.</p>

<p>We must remember that phosphorus is usually found
in natural foods bound up with the proteid and especially
with that proteid which has to do with the reproduction
of the species. For this reason man instinctively resorts
to the use of egg-yolks, and to the various seeds (such
as nuts, wheat, barley, etc.) because of their rich phosphorus
content.</p>

<p>These proteid-bound phosphorus salts can only be
properly utilised when the hydrochloric acid of the
stomach juice is well formed, for it converts them into
acid salts which are readily absorbed. Therefore to
ensure free absorption we must always remember to
give the phosphorus-containing foods with such meals
as will cause free secretion of the gastric acid.</p>

<p>When fermentation is active and the stomach juices
are weakened the germs of the intestines rapidly break
up the phosphorus constituents of the proteids and make
them inorganic. Therefore the first thing to do when a
person is found to be suffering from <i>phosphaturia</i> is to
stop the intestinal fermentation by a right diet, clear
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg579" id="Pg579"></a>the bowels of their accumulated waste poisons and give
the nerves plenty of rest. Another consideration to bear
in mind is that the nerves need fat wherewith to build
up the <i>lecithin</i>. An excessive fermentative sourness of
the stomach makes the food so acid when sent into the
bowels that the bile, pancreatic and other intestinal
juices cannot neutralise them, and so the fats themselves
are not emulsified and digested, which fully accounts for
the mental depression and debility of which these
patients complain.</p>

<p>People who are suffering from &ldquo;nerves&rdquo; in any form
need plenty of pure fat (fresh dairy butter, cream, nut
butter, fruit-oils, etc.) and an abundance of natural
fresh vegetable products at once rich in phosphorus and
iron and in organic alkaline acid-neutralising earthy
salts. These arrest fermentation and so enable the
phosphorus and the fat to become duly assimilated.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Bananas" id="Bananas"></a>CANARY <i>VERSUS</i> JAMAICA BANANAS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>R.B., Lincoln, would like to know if there is very much
difference, as regards food value, between the Jamaica and Canary
banana. &ldquo;I have heard it said that the Jamaica is only fit for
the dust-heap. Well, I cannot very easily think it is so useless,
and at the same time I have an idea that the Canary is the
better of the two. I should be very pleased to know if you think
there is much difference between them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The difference between Jamaica and Canary bananas
is due to the length of time necessary for them to reach
us from their place of growth. It takes, I believe, nearly
twice as long for a ship to travel from Jamaica as from
the Canary Islands. Hence the fruit imported from the
latter place can be picked in a much riper condition
than would be the case with the Jamaica article. This
probably accounts for the better quality and flavour of
the Canary banana. Besides this the climate may have
some determining influence. To say that the Jamaica
bananas should be discarded because they are of a less
satisfactory food value or because their flavour is less
developed is uncalled for. The disparity in price is also
very marked, so that the poor can readily procure the
Jamaica banana where they would not be in a position
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg580" id="Pg580"></a>to afford the better class of fruit coming from the
Canaries. I have discussed this subject in p.34 of my
book, <i>The Truth about Sugar</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>f all the occupations which imagination
gives us, surely none is more popular or
more delightful than the planning out of
future days. Pleasure and fame and
honour, work and rest, comfort and
adventure: all things take their turn in
our romances.</p>

<p>Not all the castles are for ourselves alone. In
childhood it is our school, our club, our town that is
to be the centre of great events. The young man's
castle is a nest to which he hopes to bring a mate.
The mother sees the future coronet or laurel-wreath
round the soft hair of her baby's head. And we all
build castles for the world sometimes&mdash;at least for our
own country or our own race. Sometimes we knock
them down and rebuild again in rather different shape&mdash;Mr
Wells has taught us what a fascinating game it is.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially perhaps in little, unimportant
things, our imagination does centre chiefly around our
own activities. What we mean to do, what we might
do, what we would like to do: there must be something
else besides selfishness and waste of time in the constantly
recurring thoughts.</p>

<p>Who does not know the charm of looking down the
theatre-list of the morning paper? One may be too
busy or two poor to go often to the play, but the very
suggestion of all the colour and interest is pleasant.
Who does not like looking over prospectuses of lectures
and classes at the beginning of the winter session?
&ldquo;I <i>should</i> like to go to that course on Greek Art.
Oh, it is on Mondays, then that is no good. German,
elementary and conversation. How useful that would
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg583" id="Pg583"></a>be! Gymnasium and physical culture; how I wish I
had another evening in the week to spare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Railway books, again, and guides and travel bills&mdash;how
delightful they are! It is easy to plan out tours
for one's holidays up to the age of 100. &ldquo;Brittany;
oh yes, I must go there one day. And Norway, that
must really be my next trip.&rdquo; The Rockies, the cities
of the East, coral islands of the Pacific&mdash;they all seem
to enrich our lives by the very thought of their possibilities.</p>

<p>Again, who does not love a library catalogue? To
go through with a pencil, noting down the names of
books one wants to read is a form of castle-building by
no means to be despised.</p>

<p>Some people get the same pleasure out of house-hunting;
they see an empty house and go and get the
key in order to see over it. The chances of their ever
living there are practically none, but the view gives a
stimulus to their inventive activity: they plan out how
they would furnish the rooms and fill the empty hearths
with dreams.</p>

<p>Is not the same thing the explanation of shop-gazing?
The woman who has bought her winter coat
and hat does not as a rule refrain from looking any
more into shop windows till the spring; instead, she
clothes herself in imagination in all the beautiful stuffs
she sees displayed, and if some of the things demand
ballroom, racecourse, golf links or perhaps the Alps for
the background, why, so much the better, the suggestion
puts, as it were, a view from the windows of her
castle in the air.</p>

<p>A garden&mdash;a dozen square yards or reckoned in
acres&mdash;is full of material for our imagination; indeed, a
seedsman's catalogue or a copy of &ldquo;Amateur Gardening&rdquo;
will often be enough to start us; long lines of
greenhouses will build themselves for us, or rockeries,
or wild glens with streams in them, and the world will
blossom round about us.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is ambition that calls us, personal or
professional; we get beforehand the sweet taste of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg584" id="Pg584"></a>power upon the tongue. It may perhaps be sometimes
the rewards of work, riches and honour and so on, but
more often, I think, the dreams of youth circle round
the work itself. We will be of use in the world, we
will find new paths and make them safe for those
coming after us to walk in, we will get rid of that
evil and set up a ladder towards that good; we will
heal, teach, feed, amuse, uplift or cherish the other
human beings round about us. We will store only for
the sake of distributing; we will climb only to be better
able to give a helping hand.</p>

<p>Well, there are some danger signals at cross-roads
of our dream-way, some precautions to be observed if
we would not let romance obscure and hinder us in
our search after reality. But none of these &ldquo;castles&rdquo;
are bad in themselves. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'Is'.">In</ins> so far as they quicken our
attention power, deepen our thoughtfulness, make our
activities more elastic and keep us from carelessness
or sloth, they are surely all to the good as episodes in
our development.</p>

<i>laboratoire &agrave; la Facult&eacute; de M&eacute;decine</i>, in Paris. It reflects a

<h3 class="center">V</h3>

<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>hough the consumption of vegetable
foods seems to offer a slight disadvantage
from the point of view of albuminoid
matters, this is not the case touching
hydro-carbonated matters and sugars.
The vegetable kingdom constitutes the
almost exclusive source of these alimentary principles.
One cannot indeed take much account
of the consumption of the .5-.6 per cent, of glycogen
which exists in the animal muscle partaken of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg585" id="Pg585"></a>under the shape of butcher's meat. There is hardly
enough in this for a large eater of between 200 and 250
grammes of meat, to find in hydrocarbonated matters
the 1/300 or the 1/400 of the daily ration. Hydrocarbons
are necessarily borrowed from the vegetable
foods. This is also the case with sugars which do not
exist in the animal kingdom in appreciable quantities.
It is the same thing with alcohol which is obtained only
from the vegetable kingdom.</p>


<h3 class="center">VI</h3>

<p>As to fatty matters, animal foods, like vegetable
products, are abundantly provided with them. Moreover,
from the point of view of digestibility and capability
of assimilating, one may say that there is a
quasi-absolute identity between animal and vegetable
fats. The reason which would induce us to prefer either
would not seem to be of a physiological nature. The
economics, which we shall see further on, take this upon
themselves, as the most serious reproach which can be
made against the use of animal dishes is doubtless their
dearness, and the reason which militates most in favour
of the predominance of a vegetable diet is to a certainty
its cheapness.</p>


<h3 class="center">VII</h3>

<p>Such are, briefly expounded and refuted, the fundamental
objections which can be brought against the
vegetarian diet and the &ldquo;vegetalian&rdquo; customs. There
exists, in fact, no serious physiological or chemical
reason for not satisfying our needs solely with foods
of vegetable origin. It may be interesting to note that,
in reality, the most confirmed flesh eaters support their
energy-producing needs mainly with vegetable products.
In the mixed diet universally practised meat plays but
a small part.</p>

<p>In meat the waste in preparation and consecutive
waste at table is considerable. To really introduce 200
grammes of meat into the stomach, nearly 400 grammes
must be purchased, and expensively put into use. What
do these 200 grammes really bring in nutritive elements?</p>

<table summary="Calculation of the fat and albumin content of a piece of meat.">
<caption style="text-align:left; font-variant:normal;"><a class="pagenum" name="Pg586" id="Pg586"></a>Meat.</caption>
<tr><td style="text-align:right;">200 gr. (mod. fat.) at 18%</td><td>albumin</td><td style="text-align:right;"> = 36 gr.</td><td> album., about.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:right;"><span style="margin:auto 2em auto 2em;">"</span><span style="margin:auto 3em auto 1em;">"</span>5% </td><td>fat </td><td style="text-align:right;"> = 10 gr.</td><td> fat, about.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td style="text-align:right; border-top:thin solid black;">46 gr.</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>These 46 grs. constitute barely the 8 per cent. of the
total weight of a ration, averaged in nutritive elements,
calculated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Table showing the albumin, fat, and carbohydrate content of a ration.">
<tr><td>Albumin               </td><td style="text-align:right;">80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fatty matters         </td><td style="text-align:right;">70</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hydrates of carbon   </td><td style="text-align:right;">350</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is a very feeble proportion.</p>

<p>If one turns to the calorific point of view, in order to
estimate the share of energy useful to the organism,
we arrive at much the same conclusion. The 46 grs. of
nutritive animal elements barely provide 230 thermal
units which can be utilised, while the total diet which
we are considering brings a power of disposal of nearly
2,350 thermal units. It is, even then, barely 10 per
cent. of the total energy. The most convinced flesh
eaters, those who buy 400 grs. of meat a day for their
consumption, must learn, willingly or unwillingly, that
the animal element enters only in an infinitesimal part
into their real substance and reparation.</p>


<h3 class="center">VIII</h3>

<p>Beyond this very feeble nutritive help is there, then,
in meat, anything else which makes the use of this
article of food necessary, agreeable or particularly
strengthening? It is incontestible that meat contains
stimulating substances, which, as Prof. Armand Gautier
has said, play the part of nerve tonics, and have perhaps
a direct action on the circulation.</p>

<p>These special meat matters are found concentrated in
the gravy. Meat gravy, in fact, beside a feeble proportion
of albuminoid matters, or solubly derived
quantities, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'polypetides'.">polypeptides</ins>, etc., in notable proportion of
liberated acids, contains a certain quantity of matters,
qualified by the generic name of extractives; a notable
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg587" id="Pg587"></a>quantity of these extractive matters being creatine and
creatinine, as well as substances of which the fundamental
nucleus is the puric grouping. These purins,
by the name which E. Fischer attributes to them,
derive from a special grouping which it would be supposed
exists in a hypothetic body, but which is not
known in a state of liberty, purin. This first term
gives rise to a series of bodies in lateral groups, of
which the most interesting are caffeine and theobromine.
Amongst these substances the one which has
the maximum of oxidation is no other than uric acid.
Caffeine and theobromine enjoy nervine properties and
energetic vascular actions. These properties minutely
studied are utilised every day for therapeutic purposes.
It is probable that the other bodies of the series which
are met with in the extract of meat enjoy analogous
physiological properties. These substances are ingested
without discernment, often in great excess, and daily,
by people who consume meat.</p>

<p>Amongst these latter, many would not dare to drug
themselves with a centigramme of pharmaceutic caffeine,
whereas they absorb each day 0 gr. 5 and more,
of its homologous <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'constitutents'.">constituents</ins>.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the same way as chocolate, tea and
coffee, meat has a stimulating effect on the system.
He who is accidentally deprived of it finds that he experiences
a passing depression. This obviously proves
that by the exaggerated use of meat, one drugs and
doctors oneself without discernment. However this may
be, the judicious part played by meat must apparently
be reduced to that of a condiment food destined to
produce in a measure the whipping-up which is useful,
and sometimes indispensable to the system. We cannot
here discuss the expediency of action and the
harmlessness of the dose of substances reputed stimulating.
But one can ask oneself whether, to attain
this object of stimulation, carnivorous feeding is indispensable,
and if vegetarianism could not supply the need.</p>

<p>The reply is easy: the vegetable kingdom disposes
of a variety of stimulating articles, such as tea,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg588" id="Pg588"></a>coffee, kola and cocoa. Through their active substances
these foods are nerve tonics of the first order, less
dangerous in their use than meat, because more easily
assimilated, of far more continuous effects, less mixed
with other substances, sometimes noxious, and consequently
more measurable. Besides, in pulse food,
quantities of purins are found as important as in meat.
If the part they play has not been systematically
studied from the point of view of their effects on the
nervous organism, they still give rise to the same
terminal products, such as uric acid. One can quite
well argue that the pulse purins have physiological
effects comparable to those of meat purins. On the
other hand, vegetable purins have the considerable advantage
of being less easily precipitated in the urine,
after the human interorganic metabolism, than those
resulting from the metabolism of flesh material.</p>

<p>This explains why a frequent use of a vegetable diet
offers appreciable advantages in the amelioration of
arthritic diatheses so common amongst us. Certain
effects observed in these diatheses arise from the purins,
from their localisation in the system, and their vitiated
metabolism. The use of a moderate vegetable diet is
the best means of treatment in order to relieve, to
ameliorate, even to cure, arthritic diathesis.</p>


<h3 class="center">IX</h3>

<p>Such are the certain physiological advantages which
the predominant use of vegetable products are capable
of offering. If one takes the pure energy-producing
point of view, the superiority of the vegetarian diet
becomes greater still. From the fine works of A.
Chauveau, modern physiology has shown us that muscle,
in working, consumes sugary materials. These are
provided by ingestions of sugar in a natural state, of
dextrine or of starch; for a less important part, the
glycogen of the system may also arise from hydrocarbonated
cords existing in the molecule of certain
albumins. Therefore it is only in an infinitesimal part,
due to the fibrine of meat, and to the small proportions
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg589" id="Pg589"></a>of glycogen which it contains, that flesh diet intervenes
in the direct production of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>The demonstrations which have been essayed, touching
the muscular superiority of vegetarians, appear
superfluous to us. Such experiments could only have
a positive value if they were made on both series of
antagonistic subjects, with alimentary powers of energy-producing
equality.</p>

<p>It should be distinctly understood that the vegetarian
does not profit by any mysterious forces. The habit
of preferring to nourish oneself with vegetable foods,
can, at most, or at least, favour the physiological
integrity of the subject, shield him against disease and
assure his revictualment with foods recognised as active
and easily measurable.</p>

<p>One cannot leave alcohol out of the list of advantageous
vegetable foods. In fact, provided one keeps to
strictly limited doses, it may be included among the
alimentary foods, on a footing comparable to that of
sugar. If one knew how to use without misusing it,
alcohol might become a daily food.</p>


<h3 class="center">X</h3>

<p>Another order of ideas which one cannot pass by in
silence at the present time militates in favour of vegetable
alimentation. Dietetics cannot neglect economic
problems. A flesh diet is very costly. In large towns,
like Paris, at a time when everything is increasing in
cost, one must be favoured by fortune to be able to
indulge in the real luxury of consuming the calories of
meat. As we said in 1905, with Prof. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'Laudouzy'.">Landouzy</ins> and
M. Labb&eacute;, in our inquiry into popular Parisian alimentation,
the calorific energy of meat comes, on an average,
to between 15 to 20 times dearer than that of bread or
pulse foods.</p>

<p>The diet with a vegetable predominance may therefore,
by those who adopt it, be considered as much less
costly than a mixed one. Does not this fact, then,
deserve to be taken into consideration and compared&mdash;startlingly
illustrative&mdash;to the ingenious calculation
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg590" id="Pg590"></a>recently made by Lef&egrave;vre in his examination of vegetarianism?
One acre of land planted for the purpose of
breeding cattle produces three times less living strength
than an acre planted with wheat!</p>

<p>Is it not criminal, or at any rate ill-judged, for the
richness and health of the country to have, by the laws
of a draconian protectionism, spurred the French agricultural
population along the road to the breeding of
cattle, thus turning it away from cultivation? These
laws are the cause, on the one hand, of the high price
of wheat, owing to the abandonment of its culture and
the barriers opposed to its entrance, and on the other,
of the dearness of meat, owing to the stock and the
land which the cattle require.</p>

<p>Under these facts economists have indeed a direct
responsibility, as for more than fifty years economic
orthodoxy has presented meat as a necessity, whereas
it is the least advantageous particle amongst so many
others.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us hope that future distinctions of
&ldquo;Vegetalists,&rdquo; vegetarians or flesh eaters may be completely
abolished. <i>In medio stat virtus.</i> The dietetic
regimen, the general adoption of which must henceforth
be desired, must reject all preconceived and hereditary
ideas, and unite in one harmonious use all foods with
a hygienic end in view. The place of each one amongst
them and its predominance over the others should be
determined only by conforming to reasons at the same
time physiological and economic.</p>

<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>and-weaving is an art, a handicraft,
one aspect of which we are apt to forget&mdash;namely,
that it is a splendid health-giver.
Indeed, all who have felt the rhythm of the
loom, as they throw the shuttle to and fro,
and in blending colours and seeing the
material grow thread by thread, can witness to the
power of the work to banish both the large and small
worries that eat away our health of mind and body.
The hand-weaver learns to look upon his (or her) loom
as a very good friend.</p>

<p>The possibilities in weaving are immense, and the
great difficulty that always confronts the weaver is
the impossibility of letting gussets into the day: the
end of the week comes all too soon.</p>

<p>One very satisfactory thing about weaving is the
fact that from the very first we can use the things
woven, even those we learn on.</p>

<p>First, there is plain weaving, with which we can
make dress materials and many things for household
use. Then come fancy and striped materials, which
require more knowledge and ingenuity.</p>

<p>There are endless varieties in bands of different
patterns thrown in with the shuttle, or shuttles, sometimes
as many as a dozen of which may be in use at a
time. These can be used for the purpose of ornamentation.
In weaving these no end of play of colour can
be made, by using many colours in rotation, either as
the groundwork of plain material, under the patterns,
or as the pattern itself.</p>

<p>Metal threads can also be used of various kinds,
either as an entire texture, or to enrich the fancy bands.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg592" id="Pg592"></a>Lastly, there is inlay weaving, by which we can put
in by hand, with little separate bobbins, as we go along,
any cross-stitch design, lettering, monograms, figures
and designs of every description.</p>

<p>Anyone with a knowledge of carpentry can make
his own loom, the construction being of a very simple
nature. In fact, the Orientals erect a few sticks, dig
a hole in the ground to sit in, tie their warp up to a
tree, and then produce the most charming work, both in
texture and colour.</p>

<p>The warp can also be made as these people often
make theirs, by fixing it to sticks stuck into the ground,
and walking backwards and forwards with the thread,
singing as they go. Yes, singing! I think we English
folk might learn from them to put more joy into our
work, that fountainhead of life and health. We are
apt to take such a serious view of ourselves and of all
we do. So often, too, we only feel the dull and quiet
colours, instead of using the many brilliant ones that
nature loves so well. Once we begin working in, and
appreciating, these we realise the exhilarating effect on
our spirits. Indeed, I think we are only beginning to
realise what a great influence colour has upon us, and
all that colour signifies, each colour having various
meanings of its own.</p>

<p>Many people are now realising that we are surrounded
by a halo of colour woven by our character&mdash;the most
highly developed people being surrounded by clear,
bright colours. It is strictly true that we are all
weavers, every day of our lives. By following the
laws of nature we make the finest texture composed of
all the most glorious colours or qualities in the Universe,
so by degrees bringing ourselves, and others, into
perfect harmony and peace.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This discussion arose out of the <a href="#HOW_MUCH_SHOULD_WE_EAT1">article</a> with above
title, by &ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; which was published in our <a href="#Pg437">July
number</a>.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p></blockquote>


<h3 class="center">IV</h3>

<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>n dealing with this vitally important question,
we shall most of us, I take it, agree
upon certain points. In the light of recent
knowledge upon, and extended experience
of the subject, one such point which now
appears incontrovertible is that there are
thousands die annually&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;through
overfeeding where one dies through insufficient nourishment.
And it may at once be said that, as regards
these thousands, the death certificates are practically
valueless as data in relation to erroneous dieting, so that
in this way we can never get at a correct estimate as
to the actual number of deaths due to overfeeding.
Bright's disease, gastric and intestinal affections,
growths of various kinds, cancer, etc., are each in their
turn certified as the &ldquo;Cause of Death.&rdquo; Most often,
however, the initial cause is the overloading of the
system with an amount of food beyond that which is
necessary or healthful&mdash;and thereby clogging up the
tissues, the organs and smaller bloodvessels.</p>

<p>But it may be said: &ldquo;How can you substantiate
such a general and sweeping statement?&rdquo; In the first
place&mdash;and this is profoundly significant&mdash;other things
being equal, it must be acknowledged by all unbiased
people that the small and moderate feeders do not
contract disease in anything like the proportion that
big feeders do, and as a natural consequence live longer
lives.</p>

<p>Further, it must surely be quite evident by this time
that there is a sufficiently large enough number of
people who are thus existing in good health&mdash;and
steadily regaining it where it has been lost&mdash;on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg594" id="Pg594"></a>lines of moderate feeding. And the number is accumulating
at a rapid pace; more and more are coming into
line with those of us who, having thus found health
in themselves, their patients and friends, are preaching
the practice of two meals a day, and sometimes only
one where there is serious organic disease to combat&mdash;thus
defying the dicta of those eminent physiologists
who &ldquo;settled&rdquo; the question years ago.</p>

<p>Now I quite admit&mdash;it would be impertinence to do
otherwise&mdash;that &ldquo;M.D.'s&rdquo; statements and views must
not be ignored, must indeed be respected. And he tells us
that he &ldquo;heard of,&rdquo; in one day, three cases which &ldquo;went
wrong&rdquo; through underfeeding; well, for those three
cases we can point to hundreds who are <i>going right</i>
through eating just enough and not too much. I am
prepared, on the other hand, to admit the danger of
a continued semi-starvation diet; our difficulty is to
define in each individual case what exactly would be
a semi-starvation, and what a sufficient diet. It is
impossible to have a fixed standard for everybody.
After all, &ldquo;the proof of the pudding is in the eating&rdquo;;
often it is a matter of experimenting for some little
time, and in this way we could judge largely of the
result of our dieting by our state of general health.</p>

<p>On some main points of the question I am now
absolutely convinced&mdash;viz.:</p>

<p>1. Excessive bulk is always dangerous, often disastrous,
causing sudden death in a large number of
cases.</p>

<p>2. Starchy foods are best strictly limited as we get
along towards middle age and beyond.</p>

<p>3. A life which is largely mental or sedentary will
be healthier and longer on a strictly moderate diet.</p>

<p>4. A life largely of physical labour must be dealt with
on its own particular conditions.</p>

<p>5. At all times due regard, of course, must be paid
to age, weight, etc.</p>

<p>6. On the whole, &ldquo;eminent physiologists&rdquo; have
erred on the side of excess of proteid being advised.</p>

<p>7. Middle age is the critical time of life in respect
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg595" id="Pg595"></a>to a man's diet in other words, I would say in
axiomatic form that as a man feeds at or about middle
age, so will he be for the rest of his life.</p>

<h3 class="center">V</h3>

<p>As a very interested reader of this discussion I should
be very glad to know exactly what &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; means by
<i>each pound</i> of <i>bone</i> and <i>muscle</i> in the body weight?
What proportion (approximately) is it to total body
weight? I have been trying to keep up to Dr Haig's
9 grains per lb. of &ldquo;body weight&rdquo; and find that it is
too much for my digestive powers, which are very weak
owing to chronic nervous dyspepsia. If I take 15 per
cent. or 20 per cent. <i>less</i> proteid my troubles are so
greatly lessened that I feel that to continue to take the
lower amount would mean perpetual relief. But there
have been so many warnings, including M.D.'s, of the
dangers of under-nutrition, that I am in a quandary;
and others of your readers too.</p>

<p>If M.D. means grains per lb. of <i>something less</i> than
total body weight, a lesser amount of proteid than I try
to take may have his sanction, and be safe for me.</p>

<p class="sig">Jno. A. Cookson.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr style='width: 45%;' /></div>

<p>There appears to be a sincere attempt in &ldquo;M.D.'s&rdquo;
article to prove that a physiologist is the best guide
in diet. But, as one can get the degree of M.D. without
any scientific knowledge of dietetics, the inference that
one would be likely to make from such an alarming
article is erroneous. I say &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; because vague
statements are made as to patients who were rescued
just in time to be stimulated by over-feeding into a
semblance of health, and we are treated to a list of very
alarming symptoms in the last paragraph on <a href="#Pg443">p. 443</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; says, &ldquo;Suppose that the animal fed for
years on unnatural food has become so pathological that
it can no longer take or digest its natural food.&rdquo; How
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg596" id="Pg596"></a>grateful to M.D. for this statement will be those who
long for an excuse to cling to the spoiled, boiled and
unnatural dishes of which the popular diet mainly
consists! And how they will continue to overeat themselves,
content to avoid the truth regarding food
quantities.</p>

<p>Living on a right and natural diet, a man or woman
will correct the effects of wrong living. This will
bring crises, and unless they know that this is Nature's
attempt to rid the body of unwanted and effete matter
they may be duped into returning to their high feeding,
either by those whom &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; calls diet quacks or by
qualified quacks.</p>

<p>I do not believe it possible for anyone to die for lack
of indication that they were eating too little.</p>

<p>The opposite is what people die of. If we carefully
read Dr Rabagliati's article in the same issue we shall
rightly ask what would be the results of analyses and
measurements in such a case.</p>

<p>About a year ago we had a young woman under our
care who had suffered with deafness and other troubles
for years. She had tried dietetic treatments, &ldquo;uric-acid-free&rdquo;
and otherwise, and had at last been told that
her deafness was incurable, being due to heredity and
deficiency in the organs of hearing. She was extremely
thin when she came to us, but we did not measure her,
nor analyse unclean excreta, nor weigh her.</p>

<p>She saw an M.D. who was in sympathy with the
philosophy of fasting, and she fasted (taking water only)
for 28 days. She then had four days of fruit juice, and
was so disappointed at having broken her fast prematurely
that she continued it for another 12 days, making
44 in all&mdash;40 days actual fasting.</p>

<p>[<i>During this period she was living an almost complete
out-door life.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<p>During the fast many interesting phenomena were
witnessed, chief among which was the discharge from
ears and nose&mdash;significant indeed to all who study
Nature's ways. Result: normal hearing restored. This
was nearly twelve months ago; and, having heard of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg597" id="Pg597"></a>her recently, we find that, though she had had a cold,
there has been no recurrence of deafness. I wonder
what assistance measurements would have been in this
true cure. The patient (an adult) weighed 4st. 8 lbs. at
the end of her fast and could then walk short distances.</p>

<p>The way in which &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo; dismisses &ldquo;a little gout&rdquo;
in his last paragraph but one almost leads one to think
that he is unaware of the failure of the natural defences
of the body that must have gone on in a very serious
degree before the manifestation of gout became possible.</p>

<p>I respectfully submit this problem to &ldquo;M.D.&rdquo;:&mdash;If
a very thin patient can go without food entirely for 40
days, with only benefit accruing, <i>how many centuries</i>
will it take for a fairly fat person to die through slightly
under-eating?</p>

<p>As Dr Haddon has said, the proteid myth will die
hard, but there are physiologists who, with their faces
to the light, are finding the truth of man's requirements
in food and who know that absolute purity and simplicity
are the ideals to be sought and that all food we eat
more than is absolutely necessary is a diversion of
energy to carnal channels.</p>

<h2><a name="A_DOCTORS_REASONS_FOR" id="A_DOCTORS_REASONS_FOR"></a>A DOCTOR'S REASONS FOR
OPPOSING VACCINATION.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>n opposing vaccination I am aware that it
is a thankless task to brave the abuse and
antagonism which everyone who attempts
to move forward in the work of medical
progress is sure to encounter.</p>

<p>In order that I may not be regarded as
prejudiced against the dogma of vaccination, I will
preface my remarks with the confession that I was at
one time myself a confiding dupe of the &ldquo;tradition of
the dairymaids.&rdquo; While attending medical college I
was told that inoculation with cow pox virus was a
certain preventive of small-pox, and like most other
medical students I accepted with childlike faith and
credulity the dictum of my teachers as so much infallible
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg598" id="Pg598"></a>wisdom. After an experience derived from treating a
number of cases of post-vaccinal small-pox in patients
who gave evidence of having been recently and successfully
vaccinated, I awoke to a realisation of the unpleasant
fact that &ldquo;protective vaccination&rdquo; was not all
that was claimed for it. I thereupon began a study of
the vaccination problem in all its bearings. After several
years of reading, observation and experience I became
fully convinced that &ldquo;successful&rdquo; vaccination not only
fails to protect its subjects from small-pox, but that,
in reality, it renders them more susceptible to this
disease by impairing their health and vitality, and by
diminishing their power of resistance.</p>

<p>Personally, I have known of recently vaccinated
patients dying from small-pox while having the plainest
foveated vaccine marks upon their bodies, and I have
seen other individuals who had never submitted to
vaccine inoculation have variola in its mildest and most
benign type.</p>

<p>In view of such experience I refused to ignore the
evidence of my own senses, and determined to follow the
dictates of reason instead of the dogmas of faith, and
have, consequently, for the past fifteen years refused
to pollute the blood of a single person with vaccine
virus.</p>

<p>I oppose vaccination because I believe that health is
always preferable to disease. The principle and practice
of vaccination involves the introduction of the contagion
of disease at least twice, and, according to numerous
authorities, many times, into the human organism. The
disease conveyed by vaccination causes an undeniable
impairment of health and vitality, it being a distinctly
vaccine &ldquo;lymph,&rdquo; is taken from a lesion on the body
of a diseased beast, and inserted by the vaccinator into
the circulation of healthy children. The performance of
such an insanitary operation, in the very nature of the
case, is a violation of the cardinal principles of hygiene
and of sanitary science.... Moreover, this operation is
in direct controversion of the basic principles of aseptic
surgery, the legitimate aim of which is to <i>remove</i> from
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg599" id="Pg599"></a>the organism the products of disease, but never to
<i>introduce</i> them.</p>

<p>The prime aim of the modern surgeon is to make
every wound aseptic and to keep it so. The careful
operator employs every means at his command to clear
the field of operations of all bacteria. He utilises every
particle of the marvellously minute and intricate technique
of asepsis to prevent the entrance through the
wounded tissues of any disease elements before, during
or after the operation. He fears sepsis equally with
death, and yet, under the blighting and blinding influence
of an ancient and venerated myth inherited from
his ignorant and superstitious forbears of a pre-scientific
age, he will deliberately inoculate the virulent infective
products of diseased animal tissues into the circulation
of a healthy person. And as if to cap the climax of his
stupidity and inconsistency, he performs the operation
under &ldquo;aseptic precautions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poisonous matter which nature wisely eliminates
from the body of a diseased calf in an effort to save its
life and restore it to health is seized upon by the vaccinator
and implanted into the wholesome body of a
helpless child. Think of the unparalleled absurdity of
purposely infecting the body of a healthy person in this
era of sanitary science with the poison from a diseased
beast, under the senseless pretext of protecting the
victim of the ingrafted disease from the contagion of
another disease! Can inconsistency go further?</p>

<p>I oppose the practice of vaccination because it is not
known what vaccine virus is, except that it is a mixed
contagion of disease. We hear much these days about
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; virus and &ldquo;pure calf lymph.&rdquo; Nothing could
be more absurd and meaningless than the flippant talk
indulged in by vaccinators and the purveyors of vaccine
virus about &ldquo;pure calf lymph,&rdquo; a hybrid product of
diseased animal tissues. &ldquo;Pure virus&rdquo; translated into
plain English is pure &ldquo;animal poison.&rdquo; The phrase
&ldquo;pure calf lymph&rdquo; is applied to an brand of vaccine
virus now in use is a misnomer for two reasons. It is
not &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and it is not &ldquo;calf lymph.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg600" id="Pg600"></a>Calf lymph is the normal nutrient fluid which circulates
in the lymphatic vessels of the calf. Lymph is
described by physiologists as a &ldquo;transparent, colourless,
nutrient alkaline fluid which circulates in the
lymphatic vessels and thoracic ducts of animal bodies.&rdquo;
Lymph is a physiological product, while the so-called
&ldquo;pure calf lymph&rdquo; used by vaccinators is a pathological
product, derived from a lesion on a diseased calf. The
difference between calf lymph and so-called &ldquo;pure calf
lymph&rdquo; is as great as is the difference between a food
and a poison. The vaccine mixture now most generally
used by the medical profession is known under the name
of &ldquo;glycerinized vaccine lymph,&rdquo; but it is not <i>lymph</i> at
all. It is made by utilising practically the entire lesion
or pock on the heifer when it is in the vesicular stage.
Such a lesion is broken open and scraped with a Volkmann
spoon until the whole of the tissue is forcibly and
roughly curetted away, consisting of pus, morbid serum,
epithelium, fibrous tissue of the skin, and any foreign
matter on or in it, constituting what is called &ldquo;pulp.&rdquo;
This pulp is then passed between glass rollers for
trituration and afterwards mixed with a definite amount
of glycerine and distilled water. This complex pathologic
product of unknown origin is injected into the
wholesome bodies of helpless children under the false
but plausible name of &ldquo;pure calf lymph.&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>I oppose the practice of vaccination because under
whatever pretext performed the implantation of disease
elements into the healthy human organism is irrational
and injurious. It is subversive of the fundamental
principles of sanitary science, while the attainment of
health as a prophylactic measure is rational and in
harmony with the ascertained laws of hygiene and consistent
with the canons of common-sense. I am firmly
convinced that the absurd and unreasonable dogma
which assumes to conserve health by propagating
disease should receive the open condemnation of every
scientific sanitarian. That this health-blighting delusion
conceived in the ignorance of a past generation
should find lodgment in the minds of intelligent people
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg601" id="Pg601"></a>enjoying the light of the world's highest civilisation is
to my mind inexplicable....</p>

<p>Sanitation and isolation of the infected offer the only
rational and effective antidote for these disorders.
Away, then, with the abominable and filthy subterfuge!
Give us health instead of disease. Health is the great
prophylactic.</p>

<p>No man in perfect health can be truly said to be susceptible
to the infection of small-pox, nor to that of any
other zymotic disease. Vigorous health confers immunity
from disease-producing agents as nothing else
can. It is usually after the vital functions have become
impaired by the effects of vaccination or some other
injurious cause that individuals become susceptible to
small-pox infection.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg602" id="Pg602"></a><a name="THE_PLAY_SPIRIT" id="THE_PLAY_SPIRIT"></a>THE PLAY SPIRIT.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>e all long for reality. Most of the amusements
in the world are imitations of the
reality for which we long. They promise
a satisfaction they are unable to give.
Drink, mechanical love-making, all snatched
gratification of the senses, religious excitement,
revivalist meetings, and so forth, most theatre-going
and sports, all simulate the real glory of life. They
bring an illusion of well-being. They produce a glow
in the nervous system. They cause the outlines of
everyday life as we know it to grow suffused. They
give us a momentary sense of heightened power and
freedom. We float easily in a happy world. A sort of
relaxation has been achieved. The less common forms
of amusement bring us nearer to the gateway of reality.
For some, they have been the rivers leading to the
ocean of truth itself.</p>

<p>Art, for instance, the interpretation of life in terms
of beauty; the &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; the man in whom sensuous
perception is supreme, offers us a sublime aspect of
reality. He dwells in the universe constructed for him
by his senses and tells us of its glories. He achieves
&ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; The veil covering reality is woven for him
far thinner than for common men. He sees life moving
eternally behind the forms he separates and &ldquo;creates.&rdquo;
And to those of us who are akin to him, who are
temperamentally artistic, he offers freedom of a kind.
The contemplation of a work of art releases the tension
of the nerves. To use the language of psychology it
&ldquo;arrests&rdquo; us, suspends the functions of our everyday
surface personality, abolishes for a moment time and
space, allows the &ldquo;free,&rdquo; generally suppressed subconscious
self to come up and flood the surface intelligence,
allows us for a moment to be ourselves. But,
still, this momentary relaxation, this momentary &ldquo;play,&rdquo;
this holiday from the surface &ldquo;I,&rdquo; remains an affair
dependent upon suggestive symbols coming from &ldquo;without.&rdquo;
The supreme artist achieves freedom. We, who
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg603" id="Pg603"></a>in matters of art are the imitative mass, can only have
&ldquo;change,&rdquo; a new heaven and earth, a fresh &ldquo;culture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there is love. That promises, at the outset,
complete escape into freedom and reality. And supreme
lovers, both of individuals and of &ldquo;Humanity,&rdquo; have
indeed found freedom and the pathway to reality in love.
But ordinary everyday people rushing idolatrously out
to find themselves in others find in the end only another
I. The religions perhaps work best and longest. But
even here average humanity, where the mystical sense
is feeble, are thrown back in the end upon ethics&mdash;and
go somewhat grimly through life doing their duty, living
upon the husks of doctrine, the notions and reports of
other men.</p>

<p>If the play spirit within us, that longing for the real
joy of life, for real relaxation and re-creation, fares so
poorly for most of us in the amusements large and
small that life offers to our leisure moments, is it any
better in the &ldquo;games&rdquo; the individual chooses for himself&mdash;hobbies,
for instance? Can these generally
&ldquo;instructive&rdquo; and &ldquo;useful,&rdquo; generally also solitary, occupations
be called play? Are they not merely a reversal
of life's engine, rather than an unmaking and a remaking.
They are merely a variant of life. They are
very truly called a &ldquo;change of occupation.&rdquo; They are
led and dominated, commonly, by the intelligence. They
contain no element of freedom. The same defect is
found in all organised &ldquo;games.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="hr"><hr style='width: 45%;' /></div>

<p>Real play, like every other reality, comes from what
our mechanical and practical intelligences have called
&ldquo;within.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Real play arises when the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is in direct contact
with the myself, with Life, with God, with the actuality
moving beneath all symbolic representations.</p>

<p>It is only when &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the practical, intelligent,
abstract-making, idealising, generalising, clever, separated
&ldquo;I,&rdquo; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; which has a past, a present and
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg604" id="Pg604"></a>a future, renounces its usurpation of the steering
apparatus, that play can be. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; to play or to pray or
to love, must be born again. &ldquo;I&rdquo; must relinquish all.
&ldquo;I&rdquo; must have neither experience nor knowledge,
neither loves nor hates, neither &ldquo;thought&rdquo; nor &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;
nor &ldquo;will&rdquo;&mdash;nor anything that can arrest the
action of the inner life. When this complete relaxation,
which has its physical as well as its mental aspect, is
achieved, then and then only can &ldquo;I&rdquo; rise up and play.
Then &ldquo;I&rdquo; shall rediscover all the plays in the world in
their origin. &ldquo;I&rdquo; shall understand the war-dance of
the &ldquo;savage.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; shall know something about the
physical convulsions of primitive &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo; The
arts may begin to be open doors to me. &ldquo;I&rdquo; shall have
stood &ldquo;under,&rdquo; understood my universe, in the brief
moment when &ldquo;I&rdquo; abandoned myself to the inner
reality. The words of the great &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; will grow
full of meaning. My own &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; will be re-read.
I shall see more clearly with my surface intelligence
what I must do. I shall be personal in everything,
personal in my play. Surface self-consciousness
which holds me back from all spontaneous activity will
disappear in proportion as &ldquo;I&rdquo; am immersed in the
greater &ldquo;me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Look at that woman walking primly down the lane
to the sea with her bathing-dress. She is a worker on
a holiday. But she cannot play. She goes down every
day to bathe in the Cornish sea, the sea that on a
calm sunny day is like liquid Venetian glass and flings
at you, under the least breeze, long, green, foam-crested
billows that carry you off our feet if you stand even
waist-high. She potters in the shallows and splashes
herself to avoid taking cold. Her intelligent &ldquo;I&rdquo; is
uppermost. Her world of every day never leaves her.
She will go back to it as she came, unchanged. Her
wistful face betrays the seeker lost amidst unrealities.
If the &ldquo;I&rdquo; were a little more intelligent, she might
try to defy the surrounding ocean, to pit her powers
against it, to swim. She would learn a most practical
and useful and withal invigorating accomplishment. If
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg605" id="Pg605"></a>her busy, watchful &ldquo;I&rdquo; could be arrested she might
&ldquo;see&rdquo; the billows, the sky and the headlands reared on
either side of her bay. She might dance into the water,
and see her world dance back. She would fling herself
amongst the wavelets where she stands and splashes.
She might give herself up and know nothing but the
beauty and strength around her. It would not teach
her to swim, but she would have taken a step towards
the great game of walking upon the waters.</p>

<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>ne is often tempted to suspect that in
some schools there is a deep-laid plot to
destroy in the bud any love for poetry which
children may possess. Otherwise how is
it that little boys and girls are made to
commit to memory William Blake at his
highest reach of mystical fire, as in <i>Tiger, Tiger,
burning bright</i>, or William Wordsworth at his lowest
ebb of uninspired simplicity, as in <i>We are seven</i>?
These are very popular, apparently, as poems for
children to recite; yet in the one case it is beyond
any teacher's power to show children the unearthly
flaming beauty which alone gives the poem its peculiar
quality and undefinable power; and in the other the
maudlin sentimentalism and almost priggish piety of
the verses are positively dangerous to the child's health
of mind. Both types of recitation work out in the end
to this&mdash;that when the child attains adolescence, and
the great world of literature dawns on the hungry mind,
an evil association of ideas has been established&mdash;the
association of poetry, the highest of all arts, either
with the saying of lines without meaning, or with the
learning of &ldquo;poems&rdquo; devoid of what wholesome youth
really desires or enjoys.</p>

<p>People may wrangle all night as to whether the
normal healthy child is at heart a mystic or a realist;
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg606" id="Pg606"></a>whether he likes fairy tales because they show him a
magical world where flowers can talk and umbrellas
are turned into black geese, or because they tell of
strange romantic things happening to a real human boy
like himself; but there can be no shadow of doubt that
much of the verse intended for children is either too
clever in its humour to make them laugh, or too bald
in its matter or tone to stir the romance that is never
quite asleep in their hearts. There are really
surprisingly few versifiers who have altogether avoided
these errors. Some of George Macdonald's <i>Poems for
Children</i> are almost perfect, both as regards lyrical
form, simplicity of language and in the unobtrusiveness
of the inner truth they convey. For example,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The lightning and thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They go and they come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the stars and the stillness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are always at home.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But others come perilously near mere versified moralising.
Lewis Carroll's nonsense verses in the two
famous <i>Alice</i> books are supreme among their kind;
but are they not sometimes just a shade too ingenious,
or too adult in wit? Probably Stevenson, in those
seemingly artless poems in <i>A Child's Book of Verse</i>,
comes nearest to a level perfection. Who has ever
approached him in his power to understand and express
the small child's world, desires and delights, without
a trace of the grown-up's condescension or
self-consciousness?</p>

<p>Well, these great ones are no longer in the world;
yet, with the recognition of their genius, there is the
usual danger of bemoaning the lack of worthy successors.
Not but what there is some excuse for such
lamentation; for this reason that every Christmas
there is a veritable flood of children's verse, a great
deal of which is either painfully didactic, painfully
sentimental, painfully funny or painfully foolish.</p>

<p>What I wish to do at the moment is to call attention
to the fact that there is one man alive in England&mdash;one
of many, I do not doubt: but one at a time!&mdash;<a class="pagenum" name="Pg607" id="Pg607"></a>who
is doing &ldquo;nonsense verses&rdquo; for children which are
guiltless of all the faults I have indicated above.</p>

<p>Jack Goring is known among some of his friends as
&ldquo;The Jolly Rhymster.&rdquo; He writes his verses first
for his own children, and then publishes them from time
to time for the pleasure of other children. The secret
of his success is partly that he knows that even small
children like a story to be an adventure; partly that
he understands how their own romances, the things
they picture or hum to themselves when well-meaning
adults are not worrying them, or rather, trying to
amuse them, begin&mdash;wherever they may end!&mdash;with a
perfectly tangible object, such as a pillar-box, a rag-doll
or a toy locomotive. One of &ldquo;The Jolly
Rhymster's&rdquo; best things begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Finger-post, finger-post, why do you stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pointing all day with your silly flat hand?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;which is exactly the sort of question that a very small
child in all probability does really ask itself when it
has seen a finger-post day after day at a cross-roads.
How the poem continues and where it ends you must
find out for yourself. It's all in a book called <i>The
Ballad of Lake Laloo</i>.</p>

<p>In the recently published volume<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that now lies
before me, this telling of a tale of wonder which begins
with an ordinary thing is again evident. Nip and Flip,
aged six and four respectively, are the adventurers; and
they make three voyages in this little book. In the
first, <i>The Fourpenny-Ha'penny Ship</i>, they circumnavigate
the world. Now please note how Mr Goring
strikes the right note at the very outset:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Nip and Flip<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they sang, &lsquo;Yo ho!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall certainly go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the end of the world and back, you know,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;From Timbuctoo to Timbucthree&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so at last home again.</p>

<p>The next voyage is to the land of Make-Believe on
a Christmas Eve, &ldquo;in a long, long

of this tale we are given a little
picture of Flip herself, and here it

Only, in the
book her shoes and stockings, the
inside of her skirt, and the squiggly
things on the top of her head are
a bright golden colour.</p>

<p>The third voyage is all the fault
of a toy monkey&mdash;&ldquo;six three-farthings
and cheap at the price&rdquo;&mdash;and
takes them among whales,
mermaids, sea-serpents and other
deep-sea creatures.</p>

<p>Here, then, are delightful little pictures on every
page, which even a two-year-old will enjoy. And here
are verses which most boys and girls under seven or
eight will like to learn. And the best of it is that
it doesn't matter a bit if they do &ldquo;sing-song&rdquo; them,
for they are the kind of verses which only sound right
from the lips of quite small children who have never been
taught elocution.</p>

<h2><a name="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES3" id="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES3"></a>HEALTHY LIFE RECIPES.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some &ldquo;Emprote&rdquo; Recipes.</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcape"><span class="dropcap">E</span></span>xaggeration is popularly regarded as
one of the vices of food reformers; but it
is certainly no exaggeration whatever to
say that Mr Eustace Miles and the restaurant
associated with his name have had a
large share in bringing about the more
sympathetic attitude towards &ldquo;food reform&rdquo; noticeable
on all sides to-day.</p>

<p>Mr Miles is no amateur in the gentle art of self-advertisement:
he would be the first to admit it. But
the advertisements have resulted undoubtedly in a very
large number of people taking the first steps towards
food reform, people who are repelled by the out-and-out
&ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; propaganda.</p>

<p>There are those who view with disfavour the introduction
of manufactured or artificial foods into the health
movement; they think it hinders simplicity. There is
a truth in this; but, on the other hand, it must be
recognised that the great majority cannot be reached
save by meeting them half-way. This applies to the
flavours of foods, the digestibility of foods and the
convenience of foods. Few can go straight from beef
to nuts. After generations of abuse the human digestive
system has to be humoured if the ideal is to be approached.
And in this invaluable work of meeting
people half-way and of humouring their tastes and
digestions, the restaurant in Chandos Street, London,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg611" id="Pg611"></a>the specially prepared foods made and sold there and the
strongly individual, thoroughly sane and pleasantly
straightforward advocacy of Mr. Eustace Miles have
been a very important factor.</p>

<p>The idea behind &ldquo;Emprote&rdquo;&mdash;the Eustace Miles
Proteid Food&mdash;is that, being a blend, in powder form,
of various kinds of proteid (the proteids of milk, of
wheat, and so forth) it supplies the right kind of substitute
for flesh foods not only because it is so easily
assimilated, but because it is in a very convenient and
easily kept form.</p>

<p>We believe such foods have a very definite and
necessary part in the progress of the individual from
the customary unhealthy diet to the better ways of
feeding. The following recipes illustrate some of the
methods of using &ldquo;Emprote.&rdquo; They are taken from
the booklet <i>45 Quick and Easy Recipes for Healthy,
Meatless Meals</i>, to be obtained for 2&frac12;d. post free from
40 Chandos Street, London, W.C.&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savoury Cheese Sandwiches.</span></h3>

<p><i>NOTE.&mdash;These Savoury Sandwiches can form a complete meal
with a little salad (dressed with oil and lemon juice), or celery
or lettuce or watercress or other salad material.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>3 oz. of cheddar cheese; 1 oz. of &ldquo;Emprote&rdquo;; the juice of half
a lemon; two tablespoonfuls of fresh tomato pulp or tomato
chutney; a pinch of celery salt.</p></blockquote>

<p>Prepare some slices of not too new bread and butter.
Mill the cheese, add to it the &ldquo;Emprote&rdquo; and the
celery salt, then add the tomato pulp or chutney and the
lemon juice. Mix all well together into a smooth stiff
paste, and spread upon the slices, and form sandwiches,
which may be eaten with watercress or lettuce or
cucumber. If the material is too moist, mix in a little
more &ldquo;Emprote,&rdquo; or else &ldquo;Procrums.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Cheese.</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>One teacupful of macaroni; two tablespoonfuls of milled cheese
one tablespoonful of butter; one dessertspoonful of flour; one
tablespoonful of &ldquo;Emprote&rdquo;; one large cupful of milk.</p></blockquote>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg612" id="Pg612"></a>Boil the macaroni for half-an-hour in a little water.
Strain the macaroni and put it in the bottom of a
buttered dish. (Put the liquid in the stock-pot, to
thicken a soup.) Mill the cheese, and put half of it
over the macaroni. In the small saucepan make a sauce
of the butter, flour, milk and &ldquo;Emprote.&rdquo; Pour this
over the macaroni and cheese, sprinkle the rest of the
cheese on the top, put in the pan to brown, then serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Vegetable Marrow.</span></h3>

<p>Mince two large onions very fine, and fry in 1 oz. of
butter; add 3 oz. of &ldquo;Proto-Savoury,&rdquo; one dessertspoonful
of Nutril, 1 oz. of breadcrumbs (or &ldquo;Procrums&rdquo;),
and one egg. Scoop the seeds from one large
vegetable marrow, fill with the mixture, and bake for
one hour. Serve with Apple Sauce.</p>

<p><i>NOTE.&mdash;&ldquo;Proto-Savoury,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nutril,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Procrums&rdquo; are
special &ldquo;E.M.&rdquo; products and are readily obtainable from health
Food Stores, etc.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Nourishing Gravy Ready In A Minute.</span></h3>

<p>When cutlets or croquettes are heated up, or when
macaroni or vegetables or a vegetable stew (none of
which are really adequate substitutes for meat) are to
be made nourishing, mix some of the E.M. Savoury
(or Mulligatawny, or Blended) Gravy Powder, with hot
water, to the thickness of gravy, and add to the dish.</p>

<h3>NEW METHOD OF PREPARING FRUIT
FOR THE DINNER-TABLE.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>In cold weather fruit is often cold, and if heated in an oven
may be injured partially or wholly. Here is, perhaps, a new way
of warming fruit which has been tried and proves satisfactory.
Wash the apples, pears, oranges, bananas and wipe them and place
on a dish on the dinner-table. Also place a jug of boiling water
and a bowl upon the table. Then when the fruit is required pour
the hot water into the bowl and place the fruit in it and cover
with a plate until warm enough to eat comfortably. Bananas
should be peeled before placing in hot water.</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Eczema" id="Eczema"></a>ECZEMA AS A SIGN OF RETURNING HEALTH.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs M.K. writes:&mdash;Until the last few years I have been subject
to sciatica and a certain amount of dry eczema. About a year
ago my health greatly improved, with the exception of the eczema,
which has much increased the last year, coming out in large angry
spots which irritate. I am 69, small, spare and white, have never
been strong until a year ago, have led a sedentary life, being an
artist. Three years ago I left off eating meat. My diet at present
is:</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Cup of hot rain-water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast</i> (8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>)&mdash;Unfired Bread with butter and pine nuts;
cup of weak tea, no sugar.</p>

<p><i>At 11.</i>&mdash;One raw apple.</p>

<p><i>Dinner</i> (1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>)&mdash;One lightly boiled egg or an omelette, with
&ldquo;Artox&rdquo; home-made bread, and butter conservatively cooked
celery or <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'brocoli'">broccoli</ins>; stiff milk pudding with eggs in it, or &ldquo;Artox&rdquo;
pastry.</p>

<p><i>Tea</i> (5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>).&mdash;Weak China tea &ldquo;Artox&rdquo; bread, and butter,
and home-made plain cake.</p>

<p><i>Supper</i> (8.30).&mdash;Slice of bread and butter; tumblerful of hot
rain-water sipped at bedtime.</p>

<p>I have not been able to digest uncooked vegetables, excepting
lettuce; nor do I eat other fruit than apples; any sweet things
cause acidity. I do not suffer with constipation.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this case it will be noted that the skin disease
occurred simultaneously with a marked improvement in
health. This shows that Nature was adopting her usual
plan of forcing the impurities outwards to the surface
and that the change of diet made this possible. With
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg614" id="Pg614"></a>her body less encumbered with waste a return of health
became possible.</p>

<p>The plan now to adopt is not to check this skin
trouble but to cure it along safe lines by amending the
diet and purifying the skin itself by means of warm
alkaline baths.</p>

<p>These baths, which should be taken twice a week at
first, are made by adding a &frac14;lb. of bicarbonate of soda
and a &frac14;lb. of &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; starch to an ordinary hot bath
at a temperature of 105 degrees, which can be gradually
increased to 110 degrees as the correspondent can bear
it. In this the bather stays for from ten to twenty
minutes to well soak out the acids and the oily greasy
waste from the surface. The starch is added because it
moderates the action of the alkali and leaves a comfortable
gloss on the skin after the bath is finished. The
bath gradually clears the poisons from the skin and
encourages the free action of perspiration, thus promoting
the further elimination of waste acid poisons
and at the same time clearing the skin and making it
healthy.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to amend the diet so that
as little waste as possible shall be formed. Rice is the
cereal that contains the least amount of waste of any
kind and this should therefore be the cereal selected.
The wholemeal, although good for most people, is not
suited to this case. A strict salt-free diet is also necessary,
as it is often the retention of salt in the system
that leads to the presence of eczema. The following
amended diet should suit the case, and it should be continued
until the skin has quite cleared itself:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Cup of filtered boiled rain-water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;Cottage cheese, 2 oz.; rice, boiled or
steamed without salt (large plateful), with Granose
biscuits or toasted &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo; bread.</p>

<p><i>At</i> 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;More rain-water (not fruit).</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;The same as breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Tea.</i>&mdash;Hot rain-water only.</p>

<p><i>Supper, 6.30.</i>&mdash;The same as breakfast.</p>

<p>When the skin is quite clear the correspondent can
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg615" id="Pg615"></a>return to the wholemeal bread (but biscuits made with
&ldquo;Artox&rdquo; would be better than the yeastless bread),
and also to a more varied diet generally, as at present.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Deafness1" id="Deafness1"></a>DEAFNESS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>J.G. writes:&mdash;My hearing got bad about twenty years ago,
caused I think by a cold in the head. When in bed I can hear
the tick of a watch with the left ear but the other is almost stone
deaf. I am not much at a loss in ordinary conversation, but
in trying to hear people speak I lose much of what is said.
Although I have no real pain, my head is rarely clear, feeling
full and congested. I have now and again a slight sensation
of giddiness or reeling. The right ear runs some offensive matter,
and there is always a hissing sound. I live what is, I think, a
simple life, but I must confess to a little smoking. My general
health is good. I am a working farmer and fairly active for one
of my age (69). My diet is generally as follows:</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;One or two cups of warm water, sometimes with
lemon juice.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;An apple or orange, oatcake and dairy butter.
Baker's bread and one cup of tea.</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Nil, or perhaps I should say that I eat an apple or
orange before each meal or a bit of turnip or even cabbage.</p>

<p><i>Supper.</i>&mdash;Potatoes with fish, and milk pudding. On some days
it may be broth with meat cooked in it.</p>

<p><i>Before retiring.</i>&mdash;Nothing but water, or at other times oatcake
and one cup of milk.</p></blockquote>

<p>There does not seem to be much prospect of this
correspondent recovering the hearing of his right ear,
as the conditions have lasted so long. He might, however,
certainly try by diet and hygiene to get rid of the
unpleasant discharge and the noises. To effect this he
should carefully syringe the ear once or twice a day
with a weak solution (1 grain to the ounce) of permanganate
of potash, using an all-rubber ear-syringe.</p>

<p>Then he should get someone to well stretch the upper
bones of the spine and to massage well the muscles at
the back of the neck to induce, thereby, a better circulation
in the nerves and blood-vessels which proceed
from that part of the spine into the ears. In this way
he will be able to ensure a removal of the clogging
poisons which are lurking in the bad ear and thus
promote less noises and a better health state of the ears
generally. The diet should be amended as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg616" id="Pg616"></a><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;One or two cups of warm water, with
lemon juice added.</p>

<p><i>At 8. Breakfast</i>.&mdash;Apples, oranges or other fruit
only. <i>Take plenty of fruit at this meal and eat it at no
other time.</i></p>

<p><i>At 12. Lunch.</i>&mdash;One boiled egg or some cream
cheese: Oatcakes and butter or good wholemeal biscuits
(&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ixion&rdquo; kinds) and butter, and a plateful
of finely grated raw roots (carrots, turnip, etc.).</p>

<p><i>Tea meal.</i>&mdash;One cupful of Hygiama, using water in
place of milk.</p>

<p><i>Dinner.</i>&mdash;Cheddar cheese or cottage cheese (the latter
is best); potatoes and a green vegetable, cooked by
baking or steaming, without salt. No broth or meat.
(Meat and especially meat broths are very undesirable
in this case.)</p>

<p><i>Before retiring.</i>&mdash;Hot water only.</p>

<p>This correspondent needs a suitable diet in order to
purify his blood stream and to promote elimination of
bodily poisons which are evidently affecting his ears.
He also needs suitable massage and stretching movements
applied to the upper part of the spine, which is
functioning badly. Then he can supplement this by
taking Turkish baths or wet sheet packs to promote a
free action of the skin and thus clear away poisonous
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg617" id="Pg617"></a>waste from the system. The same diet as recommended
to the previous correspondent should be tried.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Concerning" id="Concerning"></a>CONCERNING COTTAGE CHEESE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs C.E.J. writes:&mdash;I have been making cottage cheese curdling
the milk with lemon juice, as recommended in <i>The Healthy Life</i>.
Suppose the milk contains disease germs, would not this cheese
be injurious, as the milk is not sterilised by being brought to
boiling point? I have also been drinking the whey from the same,
as it as given in <i>The Healthy Life Beverage Book</i>. I notice in
a reply given in this month's issue that Dr Knaggs states that
the whey of the milk is the dangerous element. Since reading
this answer I have been somewhat in doubt as to drinking the
whey. I should like to know if it can be taken without harmful
effects.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ordinary unboiled milk, free from preservatives, is far
less dangerous to health than boiled milk, because
Nature inserts in the raw milk certain germs known as
the lactic-acid-producing bacilli, which protect us from
the injurious germs. These lactic germs cause the milk
to go sour and produce in this way the much-extolled
soured or curdled milk. They convert the sugar of the
whey into lactic acid by a process of fermentation. If
milk is boiled it cannot go sour because the germs
natural to it have been destroyed by the heat and it
becomes necessary to introduce fresh lactic germs into
the boiled milk as is done in the artificial production of
curdled milk. Failing this, milk will undergo, not
lactic fermentation, but <i>putrefaction</i>, and thereby
develop highly dangerous qualities.</p>

<p>When a person takes soured milk its lactic acid acts
as a powerful germ destroyer and in a certain concentration
it actually kills the lactic germs as well. It also
keeps down the disease-producing germs of putrefaction
which work in an alkaline medium (opposite to acid) by
depriving them of the sugar of the whey.</p>

<p>Boiled milk, if set on one side, in warm weather,
speedily becomes alkaline and putrid or putrefactive. It
is in this condition that, when babies take it, they are
made dreadfully ill with diarrh&oelig;a and inflammation of
the stomach and bowels. Hence it is the chief cause of
the appalling mortality among infants in hot weather.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg618" id="Pg618"></a>Mrs F.K.J. need have no fear of any harm coming
to her as a result of eating cottage cheese, but she
should not take the whey unless she has decided to
undergo a whey cure and take <i>nothing but whey</i>; in this
latter case, there being no other foods taken, there will
be no germs to act harmfully upon it. If there is much
flatulence and stomach or bowel trouble sweet milk or
whey will simply feed the germs which are the cause of
the digestive trouble, or self-poisoning, and are thus
far better discarded.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Obstinate" id="Obstinate"></a>DIET FOR OBSTINATE COUGH.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Miss N.S. writes:&mdash;For the last three weeks I have been
troubled with a very bad cough It started in the first place with
a cold in the head and then it got on my chest, and do what
will I cannot get rid of it. I have been having honey and lemon
juice, and also each morning have taken olive oil and lemon
juice beaten up together, but without (apparently) any effect. I
have bad coughing fits in the night and the next morning I do
not feel up to much.</p>

<p>I may say that I have not taken meat for about six years, and
I try to follow the kind of diet advocated in <i>The Healthy Life</i>.</p>

<p>I am 23 years of age and a typist in an office, which is about
4 miles from my home. I try to get out in the fresh air as much
as possible to counteract any bad effects which may arise from my
work. My people at home are very much opposed to my food
reform sympathies and efforts.</p></blockquote>

<p>This correspondent should consult a sensible doctor
about this cough and thus be on the safe side. It is
unwise to allow a cough to become chronic without
ascertaining the cause of it. Coughs are often due to
stomach and liver trouble, as distinguished from lung
trouble. In either case a salt-free diet will greatly help.
Thus</p>

<p><i>Breakfast.</i>&mdash;All fresh fruit, nothing else but fruit.
Apples best. (<i>Not</i> stewed fruit).</p>

<p><i>Lunch.</i>&mdash;Boiled or steamed rice, done without salt;
about 2 oz. cottage cheese or a poached egg; a little
raw carrot, turnip or artichoke, finely grated, with
dressing of fruit-oil beaten up with a raw egg. The
grated roots must be well chewed; as a change they
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg619" id="Pg619"></a>may be cut up and cooked in a casserole with very little
water.</p>

<p><i>Dinner.</i>&mdash;Potato baked in skin, with fresh butter, a
little cheese, or flaked nuts, and a few plain rusks, or a
saucer of P.R. Breakfast Food, dry, with cream. The
honey and lemon juice should be disgarded in favour of
liquorice (little bits being sucked at intervals) or of
linseed tea. I have often found an obstinate cough yield
to a diet which contains lactic acid buttermilk, combined
with the use of the new oxygen baths. The lactic
acid buttermilk can be obtained from any good dairy
and should be taken in the morning fasting and at bedtime.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Grapes" id="Grapes"></a>WATER GRAPES.</h3>

<blockquote><p>W.G.B. writes:&mdash;Referring to article in January number entitled
&ldquo;Grape juice for all,&rdquo; I think perhaps it would interest
others besides myself if Dr Knaggs would give us his opinion
on the value of what are commonly termed &ldquo;Water Grapes,&rdquo; as
compared with more expensive kinds.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the Continent the grape cure is a popular method
of treatment. It is especially good for those who are
an&aelig;mic and underfed as well as for those who suffer in
the opposite way from over-feeding. It depends upon
which condition is present as to the kind of grapes
selected for the cure.</p>

<p>Fully ripe grapes with but little acidity (water grapes)
are best suited for persons suffering from an&aelig;mia and
malnutrition. The unripe or sour grapes answer best
for cases of over-eating associated with constipation,
gout and allied disorders of nutrition. The excess of
acid and cellulose helps the bowels and promotes
elimination of the gouty poisons.</p>

<p>Our correspondent will note that for thin people who
are pale and deficient in vitality the water grapes will
be found most salutary. They are best taken alone at
breakfast without the addition of any other form of food.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Cereal" id="Cereal"></a>CEREAL FOOD IN THE TREATMENT OF NEURITIS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>E.J.H. writes:&mdash;A friend of mine who is suffering from an
attack of neuritis (not badly) is desirous of trying the diet of twice-baked
standard bread as recommended by Dr Knaggs in an answer
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg620" id="Pg620"></a>to a query in <i>The Healthy Life</i> some months since. She has
asked me if Dr Knaggs would limit the quantity of this bread
taken in the course of the day. If Dr Knaggs will very kindly tell
me this I shall be greatly obliged.</p></blockquote>

<p>Neuritis is a form of rheumatism or gout which
involves the nerves. Its usual starting centre is the
spine itself, from which all the nerves of the body
spring. The diet needs to be greatly restricted so that
the poisons can be eliminated. The most important
foods to cut down are the cereals because they are very
slow to digest and are apt to cause constipation with
its attendant self-poisoning of the system with uric and
other acids. Horses and animals suffer from neuritis
from over-feeding with cereals and beans, and the stockbreeder
or horse expert usually restricts these foods and
gives plenty of grass, hay, chaff and green clover, which
corrects the trouble.</p>

<p>The same thing applies equally to man. He should
take his cereals in the form they are the most easily
assimilated&mdash;namely, twice-baked or dextrinised. Thus
&ldquo;pulled&rdquo; or twice-baked bread, Granose or Melarvi
biscuits, or rusks, or toasted &ldquo;Maltweat&rdquo; bread are
the best form of cereal for people suffering from neuritis.
Other treatment besides diet restriction is, of course,
needed to cure neuritis, because we have to clear the
clogged tissues of the poisons which are interfering with
right nerve action. Thus we can resort hot alkaline
baths, Turkish baths, massage and Osteopathic stretching
movements to help in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>here are some statements, the very
simplicity and truth of which create a
shock&mdash;for some people. For instance,
there are certain seekers after health who
ignore and are shocked by the very
obvious truth that &ldquo;brain is flesh.&rdquo; A brain
poisoned by impure blood is no fit instrument for
the spirit to manifest through, and &ldquo;mental suggestion&rdquo;
must inevitably prove of no avail as a
cure if the origin of the impure blood be purely
material.</p>

<p>It is just as futile, on the other hand, to treat the
chronic indigestion that arises from persistent
worry, or indulgence in passion, by one change
after another in the dietary. The founder of hom&oelig;opathy
insisted that there was no such thing as a
physical &ldquo;symptom&rdquo; without corresponding mental
and moral symptoms. &ldquo;Not soul helps flesh more
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg622" id="Pg622"></a>than flesh helps soul.&rdquo; Thus the Scientist and the

<h2><a name="PLAIN_WORDS_AND_COLOURED" id="PLAIN_WORDS_AND_COLOURED"></a>PLAIN WORDS AND COLOURED
PICTURES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>hile most of us would at first sight find
fault with Mr G.K. Chesterton's sweeping
advice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanzadc">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And don't believe in anything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can't be told in coloured pictures,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>many would probably end by endorsing it.
But we should do so only because we were able to
give a very wide and varied meaning to &ldquo;coloured
pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one ever made a coloured picture of the &ldquo;wild
west wind&rdquo;; but there are plenty of coloured pictures
in which there is no mistaking its presence. We all
believe in wireless telegraphy (now that it is an accomplished
fact) which is, in itself, untranslatable into
colour or line; but its mechanism can be photographed,
and its results in the world of men and ships are in all
the illustrated papers. Music, which is pure sound, is
to some the surest path to the Reality behind this
outward show things; yet to some at least of such
music is indeed form and colour, even though the
colours be beyond the rainbow. For in truth, everything
worth believing in, all those things, those ideas,
which renew the springs of our life, have form and they
have colour. Even to the colour-blind one word differeth
from another in glory.</p>

<p>This is no idle fancy, no mere subject for academic
debate: it is the most practical subject in the world.
For even as the body is fed not by food alone but by
the living air, so is the spirit nourished not alone by
right action but by inspiring ideas. Ideas are pictures;
and the best ideas are coloured pictures.</p>

<p>Hence the great value of words. It is idle to speak
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg623" id="Pg623"></a>of &ldquo;words, idle words,&rdquo; as though they were the
transient froth on the permanent ocean of thought.
They are the vehicle, the body of thought. If the
thought be shallow or silly, the words will indeed be
&ldquo;idle.&rdquo; But if the idea be inspiring the words will be
the channel of that inspiration.</p>

<p>The greater part of this power in words is lost to
us to-day. Everything tempts us to hurry over words.
We talk too quickly to be able to pay that respect to
words which they deserve; and we read the newspaper,
the magazine, the novel, the play, the poem, with the
same disastrous haste. We devour the words but lose
their essence. Hence there is a grave danger that
through this neglect we shut out one of the main
streams by which our life must be fed if it is not to
shrink into mere fretful existence.</p>

<p>There is a curious idea in some minds that fine
language consists of long words difficult to understand.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. Most of
the great words&mdash;the words of power, as the old
Kabalists called them&mdash;are short words, words in common
use. And how common is the sound of them in
the mouth of the preacher! Not long ago I heard an
intelligent and cultured man reading one of the many
beautiful passages from the English Bible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ye dragons, and all deeps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire and hail, snow and vapour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stormy wind fulfilling his word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains and all hills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruitful trees and all cedars, ...&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he read it as though it were a draper's sale bill.
And yet it needs but a very little imagination for such
a passage to become a series of vivid pictures. Fire,
hail, snow, vapour, hills, mountains, cedars, dragons
and deeps&mdash;every word is &ldquo;a word of power&rdquo; if only
there is no hurry, if only each word as it comes is given
time to call up the picture of the real thing before the
inward eye.</p>

<p>And you may hear children of fourteen and fifteen
who have passed examinations in &ldquo;English&rdquo; recite
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg624" id="Pg624"></a>line after line of, say, Matthew Arnold's <i>The Forsaken
Merman</i> with a glib self-assured colourlessness due
solely to the fact that no teacher has ever taught them
respect for simple words. And what simpler words
could there be than these, for example&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Where great whales come sailing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sail and sail, with unshut eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the world, for ever and aye&rdquo;?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Simple, common words; yet if there is that leisurely
attention to each one as it comes what an exhilarating
picture arises of the great sea-beasts, and of &ldquo;the
round ocean and the living air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not pleading for the stylist's concentration on
words which exalts them above the things they body
forth. The most vivid and beautiful description of
dawn in the English language&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Night's candles are burned out, and jocund morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>though spoken by the most sensitively vibrant voice in
the world, can never come near the real dawn breaking
across real mountains. But the point is that those two
lines composed of simple English words have power, if
we pay them respect, to create the dawn within the
mind, and to supply the spirit with that beauty which
is its very breath.</p>

<p>If this patience with words, this respect for the
familiar fine things of our native tongue, this desire to
make them yield up their strength and beauty, if this
has nothing to do with healthy living I don't know what
has. William Wordsworth's&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And vital feelings of delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall rear her form to stately height&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is only a metrical expression of a great and practical
truth. You do not need to be a &ldquo;Christian Scientist&rdquo;
to know that ideas and emotions can affect the stoop
of the shoulders or the lines of the mouth. Other people
besides &ldquo;Eugenists&rdquo; have observed that ugly or mean-spirited
parents seldom have beautiful children.</p>

<p>But though the power of ideas is a commonplace,
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg625" id="Pg625"></a>and though psychologists tell us how much we may
improve mental concentration by letting the words of
any sentence call up each its own picture, what they a
omit to do is to recognise the need of the human spirit
for beauty. You can concentrate your thought on the
list of pickles in a grocer's price list: it is doubtless
a good exercise. But the same exercise directed to some
great phrase, such as Emerson's <i>Trust thyself: ever'
heart vibrates to that iron string</i>; or some vivid lyrical
image such as <i>All the trees of the field shall clap their
hands</i>, or even a complete poem of simple words but
permanent beauty, such as that one of Wordsworth's
beginning <i>I wandered lonely as a Cloud</i>; this will not
only improve concentration and sharpen memory: it
will enrich the mind with ever-available sources of
inspiration, courage and joy.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg626" id="Pg626"></a><a name="CLOUD-CAPPED_TOWERS" id="CLOUD-CAPPED_TOWERS"></a>CLOUD-CAPPED TOWERS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapb"><span class="dropcap">B</span></span>uilding castles in the air has always
been one of the favourite amusements of
mankind. To it we owe much, not only
of the zest of life, but also of motive power
for overcoming difficulties and reaching out
towards new possibilities. Yet all literature,
and tradition that is earlier than any written
literature, is full of a deep note of warning; over and
over again we see in the dim past the shadow of a
tower that was built in vain, of walls that were piled
too high and toppled into ruin, of crests that tapped the
thunder-clouds and drew down lightning to their own
destruction. Evidently man has seen danger in his own
desire! The castle must be built with wisdom as well
as with industry and boldness if it is to escape disaster
and to become a storehouse, a safe defence or a vantage-ground
for surveying earth and sky.</p>

<p>There is one obvious precaution we should observe in
building our castles, and that is to realise that all which
we imagine and think about tends sooner or later to
externalise itself and pass into action. Every idea tends
to glide into an ideal. Nearly all thinkers have recognised
this, and have seen that morality lies much farther
back than action, farther back than conscious will.
Banquo had dreams of ambition, as had Macbeth, but
they dealt differently with them; while Macbeth allowed
his visions to lead him on to treachery and murder,
Banquo prayed against the temptations that came to
him in sleep. To most of us imagination, sleeping
or waking, comes in less dramatic form, but we should
all think more sanely and act more wisely if we interposed
a definite revision by the conscious mind and will
of all our plans and ideals between their (perhaps quite
automatic) formation in our imagination and their translation
into fact. Slack muscle should go with the daydream
or picture of the future; we should not strike
or clench or lift until we have decided that the action
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg627" id="Pg627"></a>is right and just and wise. The girl who counted her
chickens and broke the eggs is a true enough example:
every doctor and coroner knows many instances of
results far more tragic.</p>

<p>But sometimes the vision has nothing in it but what
is pure and good and noble. Are there any dangers
even here?</p>

<p>There is this danger always, that we find the picture
so lovely and so satisfying that we cannot summon up
courage and energy to turn away from it towards the
serious work which it suggests. The castle in the air
is radiant and tall, but it is generally meant as a model
for a tougher building made out of common earth, by
toil and pain, amidst mud and dust. It is so much
easier, as Sordello knew, to imagine than to do. Actual
circumstances, real life, other people all this that lies
round us is sterner stuff than our easily moulded material
of dreams. Who has not at some time or other lain
sleepily in bed of a morning and gone through in
thought the processes of getting up, until a louder call
or an alarum bell has awakened the realisation that the
task is not yet begun? Who has not been tempted
to shirk practice of some sort in thinking of a prize?
Who has not sometimes built expectation higher and
higher until his demands of fate have become so great
that, in despair of making good, he has let the whole
plan slip away into the valley of forgotten dreams?</p>

<p>These dangers, the almost involuntary carrying out
of unworthy aims that have been cherished in thought
and the loss of vigour for real achievement, due to too
easy an indulgence in blameless aspiration, are fairly
obvious and have long been recognised.</p>

<p>There is another that has been seen from time to
time and occasionally expressed.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> We have seen that
too loose a dream-world may make the world in which
we live seem dull and ordinary. But is not the converse
at least as often true? If our thought-world is too
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg628" id="Pg628"></a>narrow, too selfish or too weak, all our ordinary work,
sound and compact though it may be, is stultified, misdirected,
often wasted. We all know how in the industrial
world something more than industry is needed;
in the emotional world something more than a clumsy
and unapprehending goodwill. We need a certain insight
to turn these solid qualities of labour and feeling
to the best account. &ldquo;A man's reach should exceed
his grasp,&rdquo; a great poet tells us, and even the birds or
beavers do not go on quite blindly with their building,
but, when effort on effort has been destroyed by wind
and water or man's interference, they at last accommodate
their instinct to circumstances so as to give
themselves a better chance of fulfilling their deeper
purpose. In many ways we have hardly outgrown
the beaver stage: wars, accidents, disease, disputes&mdash;how
many times must we try over again the same path
which has led us before into trouble and disaster before
we put our imagination seriously to work on the problem
and try to find some more complete solution?</p>

<p>Of all the dangers of the use of the imagination,
perhaps the greatest of all is the neglect to use it, the
denial of it and its consequent starvation.</p>

<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>ith your contributor's description of the
play spirit, that happy leisure from self and
its responsibilities in order that time and
thought and heart may be filled with wider
inspiration, most of your readers will, I
think, entirely agree, and all of us will be
grateful for the spirited claim on behalf of &ldquo;play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one criticism that occurs to the mind is that a
touch of professionalism, of patronage towards the
ordinary person, has crept into the author's thought
and peeps out through many of the sentences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Common men&rdquo; ... &ldquo;ordinary everyday people&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg629" id="Pg629"></a>... &ldquo;average humanity,&rdquo; ... &ldquo;a worker&rdquo; who ... &ldquo;cannot
play&rdquo;; does the writer of the Play Spirit
really show us what is in their hearts? He is an
artist in words, he is a keen admirer of other arts, he
is interested in thinking; it seems all but impossible
to him that anyone can have &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; without the
power of expressing it, without even the consciousness
of its possession.</p>

<p>We are all too apt, I think, to imagine that our own
discoveries of the mystery and magic of life are peculiar
to ourselves, or shared only with a sympathetic few,
passed on sometimes (by the <i>very</i> few who have both
will and power to do so) to such of the outsiders as
are interested enough to enter into that enchanted
garden and take gifts from it. But has not the supreme
discovery of the greatest artists, philosophers and
teachers been that the &ldquo;everyday people&rdquo; <i>do</i> live as
deeply and broadly as the thinkers and artists? They
are inarticulate and cannot tell what they see, but to
them life is made amusing, or interesting, or consecrated
according to their temperament.</p>

<p>Who can say what the Cornish sea means to that
tired worker? At least it seems a boldness that is
almost insolence to decide what it did <i>not</i> mean to her!</p>

<p>Has not every life its revelations? Is it not because
we do <i>not</i> see as God does that some one particular
life which strikes across our path cannot reveal its
revelation over again to us?</p>

<p>Surely &ldquo;the commonplace is the highest place.&rdquo; Or
rather, there are no hierarchies of the soul. Artist or
seamstress or carpenter, we live by the glory that flows
to us through whatever curtains of environment are
round us.</p>

<p>I have not a word of criticism for the writer's ideal.
All that I would suggest is that the ideal is really
present in the world, &ldquo;common&rdquo; as the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo;
flowers at his feet. Not all can sing or paint or write,
but many more can laugh or run and all, perhaps, can
love and pray.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18">[18]</a> This is article has been specially written as a preface for <i>Health
Through Breathing</i>, by Olga Lazarus, shortly to be published
(1s. net).</p>

<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>o breathe correctly and sufficiently is to live
more healthily. This dictum is incontrovertible,
and it becomes my pleasant duty
herein to demonstrate its truthfulness. And,
after a careful perusal of the hundred exercises
which the authoress has so clearly and
succinctly described, I am still more convinced of the
very great, one might almost say of the tremendous,
importance of deep-breathing exercises. What has
struck me so forcibly in this little book is the fact that
there is no undue enthusiasm evident; no embellishment
of the subject; no extravagant claims for the system
advocated; just a plain sane, sober and intelligent
description of procedures of immense value to all who
would either keep, or improve, their health. The
authoress has, as it were, laid before the reader a feast
of good things in the way of physical culture, and leaves
it at that. She seems to have brought into purview a
splendid variation of the exercises, and indeed every
mode of breathing and exercise likely to be beneficial&mdash;to
those in health as out of it.</p>

<p>Reverting for a moment to the supreme importance of
the subject, I may say that it has of late years come
home to me more than ever, and with greater insistency,
that innumerable ills of to-day are due to faulty breathing
and lack of correct physical exercises generally. I
wonder how many of us could conscientiously say that
we devote fifteen or twenty minutes regularly every day
to the system? And yet such a great deal could be done
for health in that time! No, we &ldquo;haven't time,&rdquo; or
we &ldquo;oversleep ourselves so often,&rdquo; or we make some
such other flimsy excuse; but of course we ought to
&ldquo;make time,&rdquo; we ought not to &ldquo;oversleep ourselves.&rdquo;
The fact is, rather, that most of us are too lazy to go
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg631" id="Pg631"></a>through the exercises, even though we may know of
their transcendent benefit. In the words of the poet:
&ldquo;Let us, then, be up and doing&rdquo;&mdash;that is, up in time in
the morning in order to be going through exercises
such as described in this little volume.</p>

<p>It is within my personal knowledge, and must be
within the personal knowledge of every actively engaged
physician, that but very few of us yet have any idea,
in spite of all the teaching and the advocacy of it, of
really deep and scientific breathing. If the system could
be made quite general and enforced upon us&mdash;especially
when young or adolescent&mdash;we should not see, as we
do now, <i>thousands</i> walking about the streets whose
nostrils are too narrow through insufficient breathing,
whose lungs are not properly inflated as they inspire;
and, as a consequence, who have neither the bloom nor
the carriage of health.</p>

<p>Perhaps if I show here how vastly important it is for
us to have our blood well oxygenated, it may be some
sort of encouragement for Mrs Lazarus's readers to
persevere with and <i>work into their lives</i> the system she
advocates and describes.</p>

<p>If we did not renew the oxygen in our lungs to a
sufficient extent, we should die in a few minutes. We
can do without food for many days; without water for
less days, but only for a few minutes without oxygen.
Anything which tends to increase the intake of this
vitally important element, whether deeper breathing or
exercises, will have a very pronounced effect upon
our general health. Now deep breathing is, <i>par
excellence</i>, the way to bring about this desirable condition.
It may interest the readers of this little book
if I remind them that in the ordinary way the total
capacity of the lungs is about 340 cubic inches; as a
rule, the amount of air breathed amounts only to some
20 or 30 cubic inches, but this, by special effort, can
be increased by some 110 cubic inches. Thus it is
demonstrated how much more air we could take into
the lungs by better and deeper breathing, thereby securing,
sooner or later, a greater natural expansion of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg632" id="Pg632"></a>lungs, with the result, of course, of improved health
generally.</p>

<p>It would surprise most people if they tested their
breathing capacity by the aid of the spirometer, to
discover how inefficiently they did breathe; in other
words, how much below the normal was the amount of
air they were usually inspiring. Encouragement might
also be found in the matter&mdash;incentive, that is, to learn
how to breathe and exercise correctly and scientifically&mdash;if
mention were here made categorically of the very
profound influences upon certain physiological processes
of our organisation which are brought about if we would
but mend our ways in this respect. Space will only
allow of a few such to be detailed.</p>

<p>1. The circulation is improved and equalised. This
implies much more than appears on the surface: it
means that the blood is made to flow from any
congested internal organ (such as the liver, stomach,
etc.) towards the peripheries&mdash;that is, the extremities
and everywhere where there is the capillary system&mdash;the
changing-place between the venous and the arterial
blood; thus we at the same time warm our extremities
and relieve internal congestion. In other words, &ldquo;to
bring the blood to the surface&rdquo; in many conditions of
ill-health is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>2. It will strengthen the action of the heart and lungs.
For lack of proper breathing exercises the heart's walls
get thin, the expansive power of the lungs' tissue gets
less, and as a consequence, when any little extra strain
is thrown upon either, permanent damage is often the
result.</p>

<p>3. In any tendency to constipation, indigestion and
similar conditions, such exercises are especially beneficial,
and that both by flushing the system with more
oxygen and by mechanically exerting pressure on the
different organs&mdash;thus giving those latter what is
actually a good massaging!</p>

<p>4. Indirectly, such exercises must of necessity be
splendid for &ldquo;nerves,&rdquo; as we thus get these supplied
with a larger amount of purified blood, and of course
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg633" id="Pg633"></a>this must result in better and heightened nerve and
brain action.</p>

<p>And all this&mdash;and much more which we have not
space enough to deal with&mdash;being so, it might now
be well asked, who and what class of individuals would
benefit by these exercises. The list is a long one, and
would include practically all growing children and
adolescents&mdash;in order that adenoids, narrow chests,
debility in general, malnutrition and a host of other
abnormal states might be either cured or prevented.
Innumerable adults would also benefit by such exercises:
those who are in health, in order to keep so; those who
are depressed mentally, or who are suffering from constipation,
dyspepsia, an&aelig;mia, obesity, debility, etc.</p>

<p>Even those who are &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; in years could,
with care and caution, go through such exercises to
advantage, providing, that is, that their heart, lungs
and blood vessels are fairly normal; it is only where
there is serious organic disease such exercises must be
withheld.</p>

<p>Thus we have a big field for such a system which Mrs
Lazarus has described so fully in this little work of
hers; it deserves wide recognition, and my final word
to the reader is not only to keep the book as a &ldquo;boon
companion,&rdquo; but to encourage others to purchase it and
to carry out its most excellent teachings.</p>

<h3><a name="Doctors" id="Doctors"></a><span class="smcap">1.&mdash;Doctors and Health.</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>edicine is a progressive science&mdash;and
art, if we judge by the statistics given of
the fall in the rate of mortality. Even
this, however, must be carefully analysed,
because a good deal of the fall of mortality
is due to the great reduction in the birthrate
which has taken place in the last twenty years.
Still, after this has been allowed for, there is probably
a balance in the doctors' favour&mdash;something to the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg634" id="Pg634"></a>good of the science and art of medicine. Doubtless
the science is improved and the practical advice offered
by medical men is better and more effectual than it used
to be.</p>

<p>A layman, nevertheless, may be forgiven if, with all
due deference, he is tempted to believe that many of
the benefits attributed to medicine have been achieved
through attention to sanitation&mdash;cleanliness and
ventilation. Of course this is due to the work of
science, which necessarily includes the members of the
medical profession, but it is not due to medical science
<i>qua</i> medical science.</p>

<p>The terms &lsquo;sanitation&rsquo; and &lsquo;sanitary&rsquo; nearly always
connote only ideas associated with cleanliness,
free ventilation, etc. They scarcely connote ideas of
food management, or, if they do, it is only to the
extent of inferring that food shall not be adulterated
or of bad quality&mdash;and perhaps that there shall be
enough of it.</p>

<p>Such questions as what food shall we eat, and how
much; what are the real reasons for taking food into
the body, whether it is to give strength and heat to the
body or only to supply the body's waste, as Dr Rabagliati
contends&mdash;these and other relevant questions are
usually left to unorthodox members of the medical
profession to declare upon. They seem to be very
important questions, but we do not find that they were
discussed&mdash;or ever mentioned&mdash;at the thirty-fourth
International Medical Congress, which completed its
sittings several months ago.</p>

<p>Obviously, the practical questions of food supply are
answered very differently, according as one <i>believes</i>
they must be answered one way or another, as, for
instance, in Dr Rabagliati's or Dr Haig's way. But
that they are questions not worthy of consideration
by doctors in congress may be taken as an ominous
sign.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that we owe many valuable
discoveries of medical science to qualified members of
the profession, just as discoveries of mechanical science
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg635" id="Pg635"></a>are made by men working at their respective trades.
We have sorrowfully to admit, however, that nearly
all the great achievements upon which medicine plumes
herself are in the direction of increasing the doctors'
power over his patient, and seldom of giving his patient
power over disease. It is also true that the advocacy
by unorthodox members of the profession of simple and
natural remedies often involves them in a charge of
charlatanism, and subjects them to persecution by
medical associations.</p>

<p>If the medical profession were all that it is supposed
to be, it might be good that the reformer should suffer
in solitude while his experiments and methods were
subjected to adequate tests and criticism. If the
associated physicians and surgeons jealously guarded
the public from quackery while they impartially investigated
every fresh discovery, the true reformer would
welcome the protection afforded him from the &ldquo;counter-currents
of senseless clamour&rdquo; within the doctors' own
ranks, occasioned by party and vested interests.</p>

<p>It may be true that &ldquo;loneliness tends to save the
Seer from becoming a charlatan and to make of him a
true Reformer.&rdquo; But it is not that peculiar loneliness
of the Seer that the medical trade unions afford the
reforming physician. That is inevitably and sufficiently
accorded him by the &ldquo;unwillingness of the masses to
enter into the thoughts of the Seers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> An ignorant and
inert people will always follow a charlatan, because
they like to do things which are mysterious and involve
no trouble on their part.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19">[19]</a> The reason &ldquo;Why the Prophet should be lonely&rdquo; is perfectly
elaborated in a chapter under that title in <i>Logic Taught by Love</i>,
from which I have quoted.</p>

<p>The Seer among doctors is boycotted by his fellow
medicos <i>after</i> he and his co-workers have tested their
experiments for themselves, weeded out what is false
from what is true, and proved their methods to be right.
Not only that, but too often it turns out that it is
proper food selection, cleanliness, personal effort and
restraint advocated by doctors as substitutes for serums
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg636" id="Pg636"></a>and drugs, which excites the opprobrium of medical
coteries. Whereas, the misguided Serum Specialist,
who ought to be saved from himself, and from whom
the public ought to be protected, is given full medical
honours&mdash;and facilities to become that most dangerous
type of charlatan, the licensed one.</p>

<p>There are doubtless many abstract questions of health
and disease which orthodox and unorthodox doctors alike
are unable satisfactorily to settle. But if that be admitted,
then it is certainly not in the public interest that
serum treatments should be accepted as almost the
last words in medical science. More anti-social still
is it to attempt to justify the compulsory orders of
Parliament that expensive sanatoria shall be built to
cope with disease that might be more economically and
more satisfactorily treated.</p>

<p>Is there not too little consideration given to theoretical
issues underlying practical experience of disease?
Is there not too great an anxiety to force remedies
at the public expense before all the bearings of the
different questions and their phases have been considered?
All new methods savour too much of compulsion.
They all require the provision of large armies
of officials to carry them out. It is interesting to note
that the successors of the men who told us how grievously
the Church has failed because she is established,
should be so anxious to more firmly establish the
medical priesthood.</p>

<p>Modern statecraft calls out to us: &lsquo;we will appoint
officials to inquire into and decide upon what is to be
done, but we will make no inquiries into the real nature
of this disease and that: we will find out remedies
which, in the form of serums to be injected into the
blood, shall counteract the effects of disease: we will
also appoint, at your expense, doctors to perform these
operations: we will force the man whose family may
have the misfortune to contract a disease, which the
doctors have not told him how to prevent, to submit
them to such treatment.&rsquo; But nothing is said about the
desirability of exercising government over oneself, one's
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg637" id="Pg637"></a>body and one's mind! And nothing is <i>said</i> either, but
it is suggested, that, if one accepts meekly coercive
treatment by official doctors, one may probably be
able to ignore the laws of life and health without having
to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>No sane and properly instructed citizens would be
satisfied to have State officials compel them to do what
they ought to do for themselves. It is because of this
and because the suggestions and compulsions of modern
medicine are in keeping with the prevailing philosophy
that accumulates knowledge without wisdom, that we
need such counteracting influences as are afforded by
journals like <i>The Healthy Life.</i></p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Pg638" id="Pg638"></a><a name="MODERN_GERM_MANIA_A_CASE" id="MODERN_GERM_MANIA_A_CASE"></a>MODERN GERM MANIA: A CASE
IN POINT.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapu"><span class="dropcap">U</span></span>nder the sensational heading, <i>Doomed to
Carry Germs: Woman Typhoid Victim for
Life</i>, the following account appeared recently
in <i>News of the World</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Almost unique in medical history is the case of
a woman typhoid carrier, who, it is said, will
carry the bacilli with her through life. The case is described by
Dr Barbara Cunningham in a report of the Manchester Medical
Officer of Health. In order that the woman shall cease to be
a source of danger&mdash;as she has been keeping lodgers&mdash;the health
authorities are giving her 7s. a week, and that, with her old-age
pension of 5s., will be sufficient to keep her without
lodgers. The case has aroused much interest in Manchester.
The principal restrictions on the part of the Health Department
are that she must not cook or wash for anyone. Anyone can,
however, cook for her. In discussing the case Dr Martin, who
for 25 years was Medical Officer of Health for Gorton, remarked
that in some cases of typhoid carriers the infection ceased to
exist for a time, but it was unusual for it to exist year after
year. &ldquo;The reason for the woman referred to carrying the
typhoid bacilli with her through life is,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;because
of a peculiarity of constitution. There is no remedy to be found
for it at present, and no means of freeing her from the germs,
hence the reward offered by an American to anyone who can
find a remedy for such cases. The germs themselves are proof
against remedies, and they go on multiplying. The woman
is incurable, and you cannot kill the germs without killing
the woman. It is the first case, to my knowledge,
where the health authorities have taken such measures to
prevent a spread of the infection.&rdquo; The history of the affair
is interesting. The woman's case had been reported to the
authorities, and when her lodger became ill with typhus she
was suspected, and was found to be giving off large numbers
of typhoid bacilli. She was placed in Monsall Hospital for
two months, during which time she was treated with gradually
increasing doses of vaccine prepared in the Public Health
Laboratory, York Place. When discharged, three separate tests
were made as regards the typhoid bacilli. For one week after
her discharge the organisms did not reappear, but during the
second week a few colonies were grown, and in the third and
fourth weeks the number increased. Shortly after that her
lodger developed enteric fever.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case is instructive, because it shows very clearly
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg639" id="Pg639"></a>the utter futility of the modern method of treating infectious
diseases by means of drugs and vaccines.</p>

<p>It is well known that the infecting agent or microbe
found in cases of typhoid fever originates in man himself,
that, in fact, it is essentially a man-made disorder.
Dr Budd, who was the first to fully investigate this
important subject, brought together the most convincing
considerations to show this.</p>

<p>We know further that impure water and milk, shellfish
and certain foods which are contaminated with
sewage are capable of giving rise to epidemics of this
complaint.</p>

<p>This was shown in Paris in May last, when a plumber
carelessly connected a pipe along which Seine water
flowed to a drinking-water pipe. The typhoid germ is
always present in Seine water and this mistake cost the
lives of twenty people.</p>

<p>Dr Freeman, an American doctor, who has studied
the habits of the typhoid germ, tells us that it does not
survive so well outside the human body as does the
tubercle microbe, but it can, nevertheless, do an incalculable
amount of mischief when the local authorities
are careless about the matter of sewage disposal.</p>

<p>A great deal has been heard of late of what are
termed Typhoid Carriers. There are apparently numbers
of people who, while they appear to be in good health,
yet harbour these germs and are thus liable to infect
others with them; and the problem is what to do with
them.</p>

<p>The orthodox authorities, as happened in the case
cited above, would like to isolate them indefinitely and
even to pension them off for life, but this seems to be
a hopeless way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The remedy seems obvious to me. Let us stop the
drugs and serums and use common-sense hygiene of
the body instead. This must be patent to anyone who
has any knowledge of the subject; but why the authorities
do not put it into execution I am at a loss to
imagine. Surely the right thing to do is to clear away
the impurities in which the typhoid germs live. <i>By
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg640" id="Pg640"></a>depriving them of the material or soil in which they
grow and propagate we should practically starve them
out of existence.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, this seems to me to be a perfectly easy
procedure. If this woman were handed over to me for
treatment I should at once place her on an antiseptic
diet consisting solely of salads, grated roots, fresh
fruits, sour buttermilk and dextrinised cereals. The
effect of this diet would be to cleanse and sterilise the
entire digestive tract, and thus break up and clear
away the soil in which the microbes are living. Supplementary
to this cleansing diet other means could be
adopted to effect a general purification of the whole
body. Thus vapour baths could be used to promote
skin action; beverages could be taken morning and
night, consisting of distilled water with lemon juice or
suitable herbal &ldquo;teas&rdquo; to promote free action of the
kidneys; and colon-flushing treatment could be used to
fully cleanse the colon, or large bowel.</p>

<p>By combined treatment of this rational order, I am
convinced that this woman would speedily become freed
from her unpleasant visitors and would be enabled to

<h2><a name="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES4" id="HEALTHY_LIFE_RECIPES4"></a>HEALTHY LIFE RECIPES.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soups.</span></h3>

<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>any cases of ill-health demand that the
meals should be as dry as possible. Having
granted this, it will be admitted that
there is quite a proper place for soups in
ordinary everyday food reform catering.</p>

<p>The chief objection to ordinary soups is
that they are made on a basis of meat stock and
flavoured with one of various &ldquo;meat extract&rdquo; preparations.
Meat stock, meat gravy and meat extract all
alike represent the least desirable elements in flesh
food, namely, the acids and tissue-wastes of the living
animal at the moment of its death&mdash;acids and tissue-debris
which were on their way to normal excretion
via the lymph channels, veins, etc.</p>

<p>It is therefore only common-sense to avoid such
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg642" id="Pg642"></a>soup-bases, especially as the most excellent soups can
be made without recourse to any animal product.</p>

<p>The juices of vegetables, being rich in alkaline
&ldquo;salts&rdquo; and other organic elements, are the
natural cleansing agents in a rational diet. Hence
to obtain a maximum <i>remedial</i> effect, vegetable soup
should be taken in the form of a clear, unflavoured
broth, quite apart from the solid meals, and preferably
on retiring. But for the dinner or supper soup,
some richness of flavour and creaminess of substance
are pleasing and legitimate.</p>

<p>The following recipes explain, first, how to prepare
vegetable &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; and then how to make rich, creamy
nourishing soups, on the basis of that &ldquo;stock.&rdquo; Each
recipe will, of course, suggest variations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How To Make Vegetable Stock.</span></h3>

<p>Put any fresh vegetables in season in a large stewpot&mdash;being
careful not to include <i>overmuch</i> cabbage or
other coarse green leaves, as these give a rather strong
flavour&mdash;with a quart or more of water, cover, and
simmer gently for at least two hours. The outer leaves
discarded when preparing vegetables for the table, the
stalks and stems, and the peelings of apples, potatoes,
etc., should all be used for stock, care being taken, of
course, to cleanse them well first, cutting out any
insect-eaten or decayed parts.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Mix two tablespoonfuls of fine wholemeal or good
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; flour into a smooth paste with a little
water, add this to the hot stock (as above), and stir till
soup is thickened. Just before serving stir in a tablespoonful
of Almond Cream (either &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; or Mapleton's).</p>

<p><i>The addition of the almond cream gives the above a nutritive
value, apart from the tonic and cleansing elements in the stock.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nourishing Artichoke Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, scrub and cut into small pieces, 1 lb. of artichokes
and put immediately into a pan with a pint of
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg643" id="Pg643"></a>water or milk and water. Boil till soft, then rub
through a wire sieve, using a wooden spoon. Put
back in pan, add a little more water, a little chopped
parsley, and a small piece of butter (or nut butter).
Bring to the boil, stirring well; stir in a tablespoonful
of Pinekernel Cream (&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; or Mapleton's), and
serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Leek And Celery Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Put four well-cleansed medium-sized leeks (cut up
small), the outer parts of a head of celery (chopped),
a quart of water and 2 oz. unpolished Japan rice, into
a pan and simmer for two hours. Rub through wire
sieve, return to pan, bring to the boil, and serve.</p>

<p><i>This soup is not so much nutritive as cleansing and antiseptic.</i></p>




<h2><a name="TASTE_OR_THEORY" id="TASTE_OR_THEORY"></a>TASTE OR THEORY?</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit and the Oxalic Acid Bogey.</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>any and varied are the creeds of Health
Reformers, but all may be included within
two main camps. And the opposing
battle-cries are Instinct <i>versus</i> Intellect,
Taste <i>versus</i> Theory, <i>&agrave; priori versus &agrave;
posteriori</i>, Motives <i>versus</i> Purposes. Some
overlapping and confusion of creed may be found in
both camps, but in the main one is filled with lovers of
Nature, the other with devotees of Science.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe in simplicity,&rdquo; cries the Nature-lover
from the meadow where he is taking a sun-bath; &ldquo;you
are so complex, so artificial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe in being &lsquo;sensible,&rsquo;&rdquo; retorts the devotee
of Science from the cabinet where he is taking an
electric light bath, &ldquo;you are so extreme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not extreme&mdash;consistent. Your treatment varies
every month as the decrees of &lsquo;Science&rsquo; change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your treatment varies every minute as the
wind and clouds change. I can keep mine constant
with mathematical accuracy, or vary the light to a
nicety by pressing a button.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg644" id="Pg644"></a>And so also is it with regard to diet. The person who
talks learnedly about germs and calories (though he never
saw a germ or measured a calorie in his life) will be
found in the same camp with the electric light advocate,
while this other who cultivates a taste in harmony with
Nature by consuming what he likes best of her unaltered
products, he is found arm in arm with the sun-bather.
But Science will by no means allow him to eat his
uncooked food in peace. &ldquo;If we all adopt <i>that</i> diet,&rdquo;
her pseudo-disciples cry, &ldquo;what is to become of the
potatoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, with regard to uncooked foods, it would seem
that as little fault can be found with ripe fruit in its
natural state as with any article of diet. Yet even here
&ldquo;Science&rdquo; holds up a warning hand and is succeeding
in scaring people away from one of the most harmless,
most wholesome and most neglected of foods.</p>

<p>Leaving generalities, let us come to a specific case, an
actual difficulty propounded to me by a sufferer, one
who had spent her substance till she could spend no
more in having various parts of herself examined and in
learned prescriptions and processes of cure, but who
found herself as far from health as ever. Obsessed by
certain theories of &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; this lady had acquired
a dread of sugar <i>in every form</i>. Hence her query addressed
to me: &ldquo;In your book, <i>No Rheumatism</i>, you
say that sugar is to be avoided. Why, then, do you
recommend fruit, which is mostly sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied as follows: &ldquo;The reason I recommend ripe
uncooked fruit&mdash;in spite of its containing a certain
quantity of sugar&mdash;is that it contains also purifying
salts, and that for most people it is the pleasantest form
in which these salts can be taken. Moreover, fruit
sugar appears to be more wholesome than that formed
from starch. When you say that &lsquo;fruit is mostly
sugar,&rsquo; are you not leaving the water of the fruit out
of account? As the water often amounts to 90 per cent.
this makes all the difference. Taking the fruits generally
grown in this country the average proportion of
sugar is seven per cent.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg645" id="Pg645"></a>[This statement is based on the following figures
given in Goodale's Physiological Botany:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The percentage of sugar in several fruits.">
<tr><td>Apples </td><td>contain   </td><td>7.73 per cent. sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pears    </td><td><span style="margin:auto 1em auto 1em;">"</span>      </td><td>8.26 <span style="margin:auto 2em auto 2em;">"</span>       "</td></tr>
<tr><td>Plums    </td><td><span style="margin:auto 1em auto 1em;">"</span>      </td><td>3.56 <span style="margin:auto 2em auto 2em;">"</span>       "</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strawberries </td><td>    </td><td>6.28 <span style="margin:auto 2em auto 2em;">"</span>       "</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gooseberries  </td><td>   </td><td>7.03 <span style="margin:auto 2em auto 2em;">"</span>       "</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Grapes are stated to contain 24.36 per cent, but often
contain much less and sometimes even more.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now a person eating fruit <i>ad lib.</i>, but allowed other
foods, will hardly ever eat more than a pound or two
a day (generally less). But suppose him to eat two
pounds. Seven per cent. of this is 2&frac14; oz. If he eats
only 1 lb. he takes 1&#8539; oz. sugar. Now compare this
with the amount he gets from starchy foods, say, bread,
which contains fifty per cent. of starch and sugar. As
the starch, if it is to be assimilated, must be (and as a
general rule practically all is) converted into sugar
during <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original reads 'digeston'.">digestion</ins>, we get from 1 lb. of bread 8 oz. of
sugar (to be exact, nearly 9 oz., because starch forms
rather more than its own weight of sugar). But the
weight of bread allowed for daily food, if no other
starchy or sugary food is taken, is&mdash;according to orthodox
physiology books&mdash;1 lb., 11 oz., yielding over 14 oz.
of sugar. Now I reduce the starchy food to 8 oz. or
less (<i>No Rheumatism</i>, p. 34), yielding at most about
4&frac12; oz. of sugar. You see, then, that the patient can
now afford to take even 2 lbs. of fruit, because this will
bring his total of sugar up to only 6&frac34; oz., as against
14 oz. allowed by the orthodox. And if, as I recommend
(p. 33), fruits containing but little sugar (especially
cucumbers) are taken, his total sugar under my regime
will be even less than 6&frac34; oz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As so many people fail to distinguish between fruit
sugar occurring naturally in fruit and ordinary separated
and concentrated cane sugar, or even beet sugar separated
by various chemicals&mdash;&lsquo;shop sugar,&rsquo; in fact&mdash;I
translate for you a passage from Dr Carton's <i>Trois
Aliments Meurtriers</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20">[20]</a> <i>Some Popular Foodstuffs Exposed</i>, translated by D.M.
Richardson. 1s. net. Daniel.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg646" id="Pg646"></a>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us proceed now to the study of the third
deadly food. The sugar contained in vegetables and
raw fruits is a living aliment, physiologically combined
with the protoplasm of the vegetable cells, associated
with ferments and with vitalised chemical salts. The
absorption of this natural sugar is effected by a
harmonious contact, by an exchange of energy between
the living vegetable cells and our living digestive cells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sugar of commerce, on the contrary, is a dead
food which has lost all association with vegetable protoplasm,
with vitalised mineral salts and with oxidising
ferments which would render it physiological. It is
nothing more than a drug, a dangerous chemical, because
Nature has nowhere presented it to us in this
form.... Its absorption involves an anti-physiological
irritation which over-excites the viscera, and when
repeated ends by profoundly altering them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all very well,&rdquo; cries Pseudo-Science, &ldquo;but
people may eat too much fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but then I warn them at once,&rdquo; quoth
Taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they have an idea it is good for them, and they
disregard your warnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they &lsquo;have an idea&rsquo; which runs counter to my
warnings and my penalties, to say nothing of my
promises and my rewards, then they can only get that
idea from you, Mr Pseudo-Science, with your theories
and your figures and your long words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not from your relative, Unnatural Taste?
Anyhow, it is my duty to warn them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don't heed my warning, they certainly won't
heed yours,&rdquo; says Taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can paint such a picture of the trouble they
store up for the future if they persist in excessive fruit
eating!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about persisting and storing up for the
future. I punish excess in fruit eating as in everything
else by prompt discomfort and pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you know about oxalic acid?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg647" id="Pg647"></a>&ldquo;Enough to avoid it. Like every other poison it is
repugnant to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet fruit which is so nice in the mouth may ferment
in the intestines and form that very poison. Then what
are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care that not too much fruit is eaten another
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the meantime the oxalic acid already formed
must be neutralised at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! It would be a pity to do that. Oxalic
acid is the latest fashion. What would your patients
do without it? And what would you do without your
patients?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be neutralised at once. It can only be
neutralised at the cost of abstracting lime from the
system. Result: oxalate of lime, forming calculus, or
&lsquo;stone,&rsquo; which you don't want, and tissues depleted of
lime which you do want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you get your patients after all. In fact, having
&lsquo;neutralised their oxalic acid&rsquo; to escape you, they come
back to you with two diseases instead of one. It seems
to me you are a very profitable investment, Mr
Pseudo-Science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr Taste, you would not, I presume, have
me suppress the truth simply because it happens to be
profitable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it the truth? What proof have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume you are ignorant of the fact that animals
have died with all the symptoms of oxalic acid poisoning,
simply through taking too much sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of animals? You chose such as are
used to taking shop sugar as part of their ordinary
food, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no; not in that form. The subjects of the
experiment were rabbits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! And from these you draw deductions about
man who has been eating artificial sugar for ages. How
like a vivisectionist! But what doses of sugar did the
rabbits get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About one-fortieth of the body-weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg648" id="Pg648"></a>&ldquo;That would be as if a man of 150 lbs. weight should
take 3&frac34; lbs. sugar at a meal! And since it is excessive
fruit you are warning us against, can you tell me how
many pounds of fruit&mdash;say, apples&mdash;one must take in
order to get that amount of sugar in a day? No less
than sixty pounds. Really your warning seems a little
superfluous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for you to scoff, Mr Taste, but
if it were not for me you would know nothing about the
latest diseases. I really believe you would be content
to go right through life without knowing that you had
a duodenum or an appendix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite&rdquo; assented Taste cheerfully.</p>

the excellent suggestion that readers who had experimented to

conference on the subject in</i> <span class="smcap">The Healthy Life</span>, <i>and that the symposium
should be gathered round the following points:&mdash;</i></p>

<p>(1) The effect of the diet in curing chronic disease.</p>

<p>(2) Its effect on children so brought up&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> do they get the
so-called &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; diseases of chicken-pox, measles, etc., and
especially have they good (<i>i.e.</i> perfect) teeth?</p>

<p>(3) The effect of the diet in childbirth.</p>

<p>(4) The cost of maintaining a household in this way, as compared
with the cost under ordinary conditions.</p>

heads as far as possible. The following is a striking piece of
personal evidence.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Eds.</span>]</p>

<blockquote><p class="address">Buckhurst Hill, Essex,<br /><span style="font-variant:normal;"><i>28th April 1913.</i></span></p>

<p class="center">To the Editors of <i>The Healthy Life.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sirs,</span></p>

<p class="corresp">As a slight contribution to the interesting discussion
which is taking place in your magazine, will you allow me to give
you a short summary of nearly sixty years experience of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg649" id="Pg649"></a>effects, in my own case, of flesh eating, vegetarianism and the
uncooked food diet.</p>

<p>This is not a fairy tale, as some may be inclined to think, but
a plain unvarnished statement of facts.</p>

<p>The flesh-eating period lasted for seventeen years. When three
months old I was the unfortunate victim of vaccination poisoning,
and for years afterwards was continually in the doctor's hands.
The best medical men in this country and America were
consulted; for months daily visits were paid to a noted Chicago
specialist in the hope that he might be able to effect a cure, but
it was a case of &ldquo;love's labour lost,&rdquo; and, instead of improving,
my condition grew steadily worse.</p>

<p>During all these years, drugging was constantly going on, the
pills and potions ordered were religiously swallowed, and, strange
as it may seem, the ordeal was survived. Flesh meat was eaten
daily, and, of all the members of the medical profession consulted,
not one of them ever hinted that a change of diet might be
beneficial.</p>

<p>When 17 years of age my attention was drawn to an article
in <i>The Phonetic Journal</i> on the advantages of a non-flesh diet.
By this time, being thoroughly tired of taking endless quantities
of useless, poisonous and expensive drugs, I decided, there and
then, to throw &ldquo;physic to the dogs,&rdquo; making up my mind that
if death did come, and it seemed to be staring me in the face, I
would, at any rate, die a vegetarian.</p>

<p>Within six months the most dangerous symptom had completely
disappeared and has never recurred, but, although greatly benefitting
by the new diet, and enjoying on the whole fairly good
health, yet there were frequent attacks of rheumatism, lumbago
and neuralgia; dyspepsia, with its attendant pain and flatulence,
often made life miserable; now and again the liver would rise
up in rebellion, bringing in its train vertigo, blurred vision and
severe headaches; constipation, that bane of modern life, was a
source of endless trouble, in fact, for many years the enema had
to be used once or twice a week, and last, but worst of all, came
those sharp, shooting, lancinating pains, one of the premonitory
symptoms of cancer.</p>

<p>Obviously, there was still something radically wrong somewhere,
and on retiring from practice, a great deal of time and attention
was devoted to the subject, innumerable experiments were made,
and, ultimately, results obtained, the value of which cannot be
exaggerated.</p>

<p>Five years ago the uncooked food diet was commenced, and
from the very first week a steady improvement took place. The
constipation vanished as if by magic; there has not been the
slightest touch of rheumatism or neuralgia for at least three years
the liver is now an unknown quantity, the dyspepsia is a thing of
the past, and, most important of all, the cancer symptoms are
entirely gone, and in their place has come an abounding health,
vigour and vitality that is marvellous. The years seem to have
&ldquo;rolled back in their flight&rdquo;; all the centres of life are reju<a class="pagenum" name="Pg650" id="Pg650"></a>venated;
and the hopes, feelings and aspirations of youth sway me
now as they did nearly half-a-century ago. Work, mental or
physical, is a perfect pleasure, and to feel fatigue is almost
unknown.</p>

<p>What a glorious gift life really is has never been realised till
now, and the wealth of the Indies would not induce me to go
back to the flesh-pots, or live on cooked foods again. This diet
gives two important advantages: firstly, the elimination of all
excess of starchy matter prevents the formation of needless fat,
and, secondly, the entire absence of artificially sweetened food
removes one of the main causes of over-eating.</p>

<p>Will people ever learn that fat, instead of being a sign of health,
is the very reverse, that every ounce of superfluous adipose tissue
means more work for the heart, diminished vitality, lessened
energy, and, when excessive, is not only a distinct menace to
longevity, but to life itself?</p>

<p>I never take more than two meals a day and very often only
one, which consists of raw vegetables, nuts, olive oil and unfired
bread; the second meal, when required, is a simple fruit salad.</p>

<p>When a vegetarian the writer lived for years on a shilling a
week; it costs rather more now, the oil, nuts, fruit and bread
being more expensive than beans, rice, meal, etc., but the difference
is so trifling that it is not worth talking about.</p>

<p>Whilst &ldquo;Fletcherising,&rdquo; deep breathing, distilled water, olive
oil, fasting, saltless food, the open-air life, regular exercise, etc.,
were valuable allies, it was not until the powerful aid of uncooked
food was invoked that the real benefits began to appear and life
became a real joy. Yours, etc.,</p>

quotations from old herbal books, and it gives the
history, use and folklore of these interesting edibles.
I am not responsible for this recipe and cannot therefore
vouch for its utility. We know, however, that
onions contain a wonderful sulphured oil and that
sulphur in one form or another is an important ingredient
of most hair preparations which restore colour.
The raw juice evidently should be used, and this can
be extracted either by pounding and grating and then
extracting the juice under pressure, or it can be readily
obtained in any quantity by putting onions through the
Enterprise Juice Press. The amount of honey, I think,
to be added to this juice should be very small, otherwise,
as our correspondent surmises, the preparation would be
very sticky and objectionable. Would any reader care
to try this and report upon it?</p>

<h3 class="health"><a name="Sciatica" id="Sciatica"></a>SCIATICA.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mrs M.G. writes:&mdash;My husband is a sufferer from sciatica;
has had it for some years, on and off, but just lately he seems is
to get it constantly&mdash;sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. He has
been taking some salicylate of soda, and I have tried to persuade
him to give it up. His age is 42. For his meals he takes, on
rising, an apple or a cup of apple tea; an hour afterwards his
breakfast, which consists of two tablespoonfuls of a proteid food
mixed with distilled water, and a hard biscuit, two slices of
whole meal brown bread, nut butter, and watercress or lettuce.
During the morning he drinks barley water. For dinner, a salad
and a few ground nuts and hard biscuits and an apple; sometimes
home-made nut meat and spinach, hard biscuits and dried or fresh
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg652" id="Pg652"></a>fruit. For tea, a salad or lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cress,
and Shredded Wheat and wholemeal bread. Last thing at night,
a few steamed onions and distilled water. His bowels are in
good condition, very regular, but he has this constant gnawing
pain. If you can help me in any way as to a change in his
diet, it will be a relief to me. I do not mind the trouble of
preparing things for him. It is about two months ago that he
has taken to drinking distilled water, which I make myself. His
occupation is very sedentary, with long hours, sometimes from
six in the morning till nine at night. He has a bicycle, and gets
as much exercise as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the description given one would assume that
the sedentary occupation and long hours of work have
caused this correspondent to fall into bad postural habits
of sitting and standing, coupled with excessive depletion
of his nervous energy. The diet given is on good lines
and, with the addition of home-made curd cheese and
eggs as proteid, might certainly be continued as it
stands, especially as the bowel action is regular. What
the correspondent does need is less hours of work; more
physical exercises of a brisk back-stretching nature, and
certain spinal stretching manipulations of an Osteopathic
nature. Full deep breathing in fresh air will
also be beneficial. The lower part of the spine, from
which the sciatic nerves originate, needs the most
attention.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Paraffin" id="Paraffin"></a>REFINED PARAFFIN AS A CONSTIPATION REMEDY.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mr E.H. writes:&mdash;Will Dr Knaggs very kindly say whether
Refined Paraffin, now being given so generally for the relief of
constipation, may be regarded as a harmless method of overcoming
this trouble or whether its use might lead to harmful
results. I am told that this preparation of oil is not assimilated,
and is therefore harmless, but I should much appreciate Dr
Knaggs' opinion on this matter.</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of refined paraffin as a remedy for constipation
is just now all the rage with the orthodox medical
profession. There is nothing really to be said against
its right use, provided it is made to serve as one of the
means to an end. It has been proved that this paraffin,
which is quite tasteless, odourless and easy to swallow,
is not absorbed by the system but passes unchanged
and unaltered through it. It acts therefore as a mere
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg653" id="Pg653"></a>mechanical lubricant. The one thing to remember is
that its use should be combined with a curative diet,
so that it need not be taken indefinitely.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="DSD" id="DSD"></a>(1) DRY THROAT; (2) SACCHARINE; (3) DILATED
HEART.</h3>

<blockquote><p>Mr L.S. writes:&mdash;I have read <i>The Healthy Life</i> from the
appearance of the first number, and I have studied the Answers
to Correspondents, but have not observed a case identical with
my own, hence my reason for troubling you.</p>

<p>(1) The back part of mouth next throat has a curious glazed
appearance&mdash;no cough or expectoration. I am inclined to think
it extends to and includes the stomach. I have always a good
appetite, but am not well nourished; much under weight. Age
44 years; school officer; cycle 25 miles a week.</p>

<p>Eat meat sparingly, not a pound a week. Live principally upon
eggs and bread and butter&mdash;(three eggs a day): &ldquo;Digestive Tea&rdquo;
two and three times a day.</p>

<p>2. Is saccharine less harmful than sugar for sweetening?</p>

<p>3. As the result of a nervous breakdown I had five years ago
I suffer from a dilated heart, consequently&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I have
palpitation occasionally, oftener when in bed. I don't think my
heart is really normal since my breakdown five years ago.</p>

<p>4. Would bathing myself with cold water over the region of the
heart strengthen the muscles? Would you please suggest anything
for strengthening heart. Are lemons or eggs injurious to the
heart?</p></blockquote>

<p>1. The throat symptoms indicate a dry, irritable,
heated condition of the mouth and throat which, as
the correspondent surmises, equally affects the stomach
and the rest of the digestive organs. He should have a
breakfast of fresh fruit only, take salads and grated
raw roots with his meals and stop tea altogether. He
can drink distilled water and vegetable or lemon drinks
(unsweetened) instead.</p>

<p>2. Saccharine is a mineral substance, a fossilised
product of putrefactive action in the coal age. It is
closely analogous to carbolic acid, which equally originates
from microbic action. By leaving off sugar and
replacing it by saccharine our correspondent gains
nothing. He is simply leaping from the frying pan into
the fire. It is best for him to cultivate a taste for
unsweetened or even acid drinks.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg654" id="Pg654"></a>3. A dilated heart is usually an after effect of a
dilated stomach, which strains it, just as it does every
other organ, whether in the chest or the abdomen.</p>

<p>4. Bathing the chest with cold water is not desirable.
What is needed is that the correspondent should drink
as little fluid as possible and pay close attention to the
condition of his digestive mechanism. If the organs
are dilated or misplaced he should wear a belt and take
suitable gentle Osteopathic exercises.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Stammering" id="Stammering"></a>TREATMENT FOR STAMMERING.</h3>

<blockquote><p>A.M.D. writes:&mdash;Could you kindly give in <i>The Healthy Life</i>
magazine some suggestions as to the best method to follow in a
case of stammering (slight) in a boy of ten or eleven years who
has been rather left to himself, the hesitancy in speech being
regarded as incurable?</p></blockquote>

<p>This boy should be trained by someone who understands
how to cure stammering. The correspondent
would do well to consult Miss Behncke of 18 Earl's
Court Square, S.W., who makes a speciality of treating
such cases.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="Anaemia" id="Anaemia"></a>WHY THE RED CORPUSCLES ARE DEFICIENT IN
AN&AElig;MIA.</h3>

<blockquote><p>A.M.D. writes:&mdash;Is there any way, independent of diet, of
increasing the red corpuscles in the blood? I have tried walking
nine miles a day, thus getting up free perspirations. What of this
method? I did imagine that this resulted in a better condition
of the skin, the latter losing in a measure the white and parched
appearance.</p></blockquote>

<p>A deficiency of red corpuscles in the blood, which
shows in an&aelig;mia, is usually caused by self-poisoning.
When food ferments or putrifies in the colon, owing to
faulty diet and other causes, certain toxins are created.
These become absorbed into the blood and there destroy
the red corpuscles. Walking is a good form of exercise,
but it will not suffice alone to remedy this type of
an&aelig;mia unless the diet and general habits of the patient
are so arranged that the unsanitary condition of the
colon is also remedied. The correspondent will find, if
she studies the replies to others in this magazine, many
details as to diet, etc., for rectifying bad conditions in
the bowels.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a class="pagenum" name="Pg655" id="Pg655"></a><a name="Blending" id="Blending"></a>THE CORRECT BLENDING OF FOODS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>T.B.W. writes:&mdash;Is it inadvisable for a dyspeptic (and sufferer
from constipation) to eat salad, or cooked vegetables, and stewed
fruit at the same meal; also, do I do right in eating bread and
butter (preferably crust) or hard biscuits with stewed fruit or
soft vegetables, etc.? Would you please inform me the best Still
that I can obtain&mdash;preferably one that does not require much
attention, and is fairly portable, and that does not cost much
to work?</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not believe that it is right to mix salads or
cooked vegetables with stewed fruits. It is better to
take them at separate meals.</p>

<p>It is, in my view, equally bad to take cereals (<i>i.e.</i>
bread, biscuits, etc.) with stewed fruits. The reason
is that cereals call for an alkaline form of digestion in
the mouth which the acid fruits or the added sugar
greatly retard.</p>

<p>I believe strongly in the all-fruit breakfast or all-fruit
supper, when fresh, dried, or even stewed dried
fruits (possibly with some fresh cream) can be taken
alone, without either cereals or vegetables.</p>

<p>Cereals go best with salads and cooked vegetables,
because of the alkalinity of the latter which harmonises
with the salivary secretion intended for the digestion of
grains.</p>

<p>The Gem Still is the best to buy. It is well made and
does not need much attention. The large automatic
commercial size is, however, the best if any quantity
is needed, as it works throughout the day with practically
no attention when properly adjusted.</p>


<h3 class="health"><a name="NonFlesh" id="NonFlesh"></a>DIFFICULTIES IN CHANGING TO NON-FLESH DIET.</h3>

<blockquote><p>F.C.W. writes:&mdash;I shall be glad if you will inform me from
your experience whether, after one has broken from the customary
meat diet and adopted a &ldquo;reform&rdquo; diet, there is any real difficulty
in reverting to the former state. I have seen it stated that
vegetarian diet did not call into action all the natural powers of
the digestive organs, and, this being so, the tendency was for
them to become weakened so that the food reformer eventually
found himself unable to digest meat. I believe some health
culturists make practice of taking meat twice a week. I have
been about seven or eight weeks on reform diet, and though better
in some ways have to confess to a feeling of deficient energy and
nerve power. I was once told by a doctor that I could not afford
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg656" id="Pg656"></a>to do without the stimulating effect derived from meat. I propose
making a test of the two methods, but should like to hear from
you in reply to the above query. Another new feature I have
noticed on the new diet is a thinness of the teeth and a feeling
of weakness in them generally.</p></blockquote>

<p>This correspondent omitted to supply his amended
diet, so this was asked for and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>On rising</i> (6.40).&mdash;Cup of cold water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast</i> (8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>).&mdash;Porridge, boiled egg or white fish done in
oven. Turog brown bread and butter; a banana; cup of coffee.</p>

<p><i>Lunch</i> (12.45, <i>at The Home Restaurant</i>)&mdash;Nut or cheese
savoury and one vegetable, a sweet dish, a few dates or a nut and
fruit cake.</p>

<p><i>Tea meal (in office at 5).</i>&mdash;Bread and butter, piece of cake,
large cup of cocoa.</p>

<p><i>Supper.</i>&mdash;One of following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) &ldquo;Force&rdquo; with stewed prunes and junket; small piece of
cheese with wholemeal biscuit.</p>

<p>(b) Milk pudding and stewed fruit; small piece of cheese and
biscuit.</p>

<p>(c) Vegetable soup with toast.</p>

<p>(d) Bread and milk and fruit cake.</p>

<p><i>On retiring</i> (10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>).&mdash;Cup of hot milk.</p></blockquote>

<p>The correspondent adds further:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I have only been about eight weeks on food reform and the
general result, so far, is less susceptibility to draughts and ability
to sleep with windows open top and bottom, which I could not do
before, and a feeling of lightness and freshness. On the other
hand, I have not the same nerve force or power. I am of a
highly sensitive nervous disposition, and the latest trouble is with
my teeth. I was told yesterday by a dentist that a non-flesh diet
is harmful to them and that were one to eat meat only, there
would be no trouble! Perhaps it is owing to the dates and nut-and-fruit
cakes which I have been eating, or to a general weakened
condition due to want of finding my natural diet. I have a friend
who is a fine specimen of physical development, and on his going
on to food reform he had to have his teeth seen to. I suppose it
would not be the softer diet giving his teeth less to do. I am at a
disadvantage as I can get nothing specially prepared at home and
can only add to my diet articles which I can prepare myself. I
like my liquids fairly sweet and I like liquid foods. I am a
catarrhal subject and when this starts at the back of the nose the
hearing is affected.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever a person changes from a meat diet to one
that is of the non-flesh order the digestive organs have
to learn how to adjust their secretions to the altered
diet. This applies just as forcibly when a food reformer
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg657" id="Pg657"></a>wishes to return to the &ldquo;flesh-pots.&rdquo; After a long
course of abstinence from meat the food reformer does
find it difficult to return to it. This is due not so much
to the difficulty in digesting it as to the violent stimulation
and grossening of the body which it induces.</p>

<p>I have never heard of any food reformer who discarded
meat for ethical or humane reasons who willingly
returned to meat so that he could if necessary be in a
position to digest it.</p>

<p>With regard to the loss of energy and nerve power
the correspondent must distinguish between real weakness
and absence of stimulation. The first effects of
discarding meat show a deficient energy due to the
absence of stimulation. When this has passed it gives
place to a feeling of buoyancy and energy which is
permanent.</p>

<p>The dental weakness is aggravated, if indeed it is not
actually <i>caused</i>, by the milk puddings, porridge, cake
and sugared beverages which are a feature of this
correspondent's diet, and to the absence of salad vegetables.
If he amended his diet somewhat as follows he
should make steady progress in energy and general
fitness:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On rising.</i>&mdash;Tumblerful of cold water.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast</i> (7.15).&mdash;One lightly boiled, baked or
poached egg; Veda bread and butter, a little watercress
or other salad. A small cup of Hygiama in place of
the sugared cocoa.</p>

<p><i>Lunch</i> (12.45).&mdash;Nut or cheese savoury and one vegetable;
baked pudding by preference for second course,
or simply a nut and fruit cake; no dates.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> salad with grated cheese or cream cheese, or flaked
pine nuts; followed by a piece of the excellent wholemeal
cake supplied at the restaurant this correspondent
frequents.</p>

<p><i>Tea meal.</i>&mdash;One cup of Salfon cocoa (unsweetened),
preferably without other food.</p>

<p><i>Supper</i> (6 to 7) (This meal is at present far too
mushy).&mdash;Cream cheese, Veda bread with fresh butter or
<a class="pagenum" name="Pg658" id="Pg658"></a>nut butter, salad, tomatoes, cucumber, etc., with dressing
of pure oil and lemon juice.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> simply fresh ripe fruit, with dried fruit and cream;
no cereals.</p>

<p><i>On retiring.</i>&mdash;Cupful of hot unsweetened lemon water,
or weak barley water; no milk.</p>

from country farms is&mdash;well, it's unthinkable. There's
a saying that what the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't
grieve over, but that doesn't alter the fact that the
average cow is none too clean, the average milker's
hands and clothes (to say nothing of his face, hat and
head) none too clean, the milking-place none too clean,
and the circumstances of transit such as don't make for
cleanliness. I have put it very moderately, as those
who know country dairy farms will admit. Those who
particularly want clean cheese from uncooked milk
should buy it from a County Council dairy farm or

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
